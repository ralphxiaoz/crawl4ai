Together, these capabilities enable TechBridge to deliver a fully consolidated 360° telecom circularity and ESG framework empowering mobile network operators to seamlessly manage network asset recovery, device recirculation, e-waste reduction, refurbishment, regulatory compliance, and auditable ESG reporting through one unified, AI-driven ecosystem.\nAs telecom operators accelerate the rollout of 5G and fibre networks, the sector is experiencing unprecedented equipment turnover, resulting in mounting electronic waste and intensifying regulatory pressure. Industry experts estimate telecom-related e-waste now exceeds 4.6 million metric tons annually; this is equivalent to 1 million cars taken off the road. In parallel, ESG reporting mandates and Net Zero commitments are creating a need for intelligent systems that can deliver both environmental and financial performance.\n> \"TechBridge offers a future-ready solution that aligns perfectly with Basatne's mission to operationalize circularity at scale,\" said Ammar Aboulnasr, CEO of Basatne. \"Our closed-loop circularity ecosystem is now one of the most mature and unique in the industry, plugging directly into the operator network-upgrade cycle and unlocking an estimated USD 145 billion market opportunity across device recirculation, network-asset recovery, and ESG-driven lifecycle compliance.\"\nWe're not just reducing waste, we're building an integrated system where operators can track every asset, recover more value, accelerate upgrade programs, and report sustainability with full confidence.\nTechBridge delivers a true end-to-end circularity and reporting solution for telecom operators, combining strategic consultancy, full operational execution, and direct coordination with vendors to ensure seamless asset redeployment or resale globally. Its intelligent platform, TechBridge Insights, enables operators to monitor the condition, location, and value of their infrastructure and devices in real time, identify assets suitable for redeployment or repurposing, and maximise value recovery while reducing environmental impact.\n> \"I am extremely proud to be joining forces with Basatne to offer the first truly end-to-end circular ecosystem for telecom operators,\" said Isaiah Wilks, CEO of TechBridge. \"Together, Basatne and TechBridge are equipping operators with the infrastructure and intelligence needed to transform sustainability from a compliance requirement into a strategic advantage. We are delivering solutions that are good for the planet, good for society, and profitable for telecom operators and their customers.\"\nThe integration sets a new benchmark for embedding circularity performance and lifecycle efficiency directly into telecom infrastructure. As the industry accelerates its transition toward long-term sustainability strategies, this partnership places Basatne and TechBridge at the heart of what is shaping up to be a multi-billion-dollar market.\n#### **About Basatne**\nFounded with a vision to transform global trade, Basatne began as a family-run business and evolved into an international leader in sustainable commerce and circular technology.

Built under its flagship brand **Cartlow** , Basatne introduces the region’s first **subscription-based, zero-commission multi-seller platform** , transforming how businesses operate and grow. This new model replaces traditional sales commissions with a simple subscription, giving sellers **predictable costs, higher margins,** and **freedom to scale across markets.** By enabling millions of products to be continuously recirculated, **Cartlow** drives the shift from linear consumption to a truly circular economy—where **technology, trade, and sustainability move together.**\nWith its proprietary digital infrastructure, Basatne has developed an ecosystem that seamlessly connects **consumer marketplaces** with **wholesale trading networks** , ensuring that products and devices are **recaptured, refurbished, resold, or reused** rather than discarded. This model is designed to recirculate **millions of devices every year** , positioning **Basatne MENA** as a central force in advancing the circular economy across a market projected to exceed **USD 30 billion** in value.\nThe **zero-commission subscription model** replaces the traditional marketplace structure that charges sellers up to **20% per transaction**. Instead, it enables **direct value exchange** between sellers and consumers, unlocking **more competitive pricing** and **fairer value distribution** across the retail ecosystem. This approach strengthens both the **economic** and **environmental** case for circular retail, making **sustainable consumption more accessible and scalable.**\n> “At Basatne MENA, our mission is to make sustainability scalable,” said **Mohammad Sleiman** , CEO of Basatne MENA. “By digitizing the product lifecycle and eliminating cost barriers, we are enabling a model where affordability and sustainability reinforce each other. This is not just a retail adjustment—it is a fundamental shift in how value moves through the economy.”\nAs Basatne continues to expand its circular commerce infrastructure, the company is shaping a future where **economic growth and environmental responsibility** advance together—establishing the foundation for a more **resilient and resource-efficient digital economy** across the GCC.\n## Global Reach\nAcross North America, the Middle East, and expanding into Europe.\n#### Trade\n# URL: https://www.basatne.com/blog/basatne-mena-and-likewize-launch-regions-first-subscription-based-handset-program-upgrade-protect\nBlog\n# Basatne MENA and Likewize launch region’s first subscription-based handset program: ‘Upgrade & Protect’\nDesigned to combine sustainability, flexibility, and seamless user experience\nBlog\n>\nBasatne MENA and Likewize launch region’s first subscription-based handset program: ‘Upgrade & Protect’\nPublished:\nJune 16, 2025\n**Dubai, United Arab Emirates** – In a landmark partnership set to reshape the region’s telecom landscape, Basatne MENA, the regional arm of global circular economy leader Basatne, has partnered with Likewize, the global leader in device lifecycle services, to launch ‘Upgrade & Protect’, the Middle East’s first subscription-based smartphone program designed to combine sustainability, flexibility, and seamless user experience.\nWith smartphone users in the GCC replacing devices every 12–18 months and over 50 million active handsets in circulation, ‘Upgrade & Protect’ transforms traditional instalment plans into a dynamic monthly subscription that empowers consumers to swap, upgrade, or protect their devices anytime. For telcos, the model unlocks new recurring revenue streams while aligning with growing ESG mandates.\nThis innovation arrives at a pivotal time, with UAE and GCC markets moving rapidly toward Net Zero and green digital transformation. The program aligns closely with the UAE’s Net Zero by 2050 Strategy and the GSMA’s Circular Economy for Mobile Devices initiative, supporting a shift away from linear consumption toward a more regenerative, technology-enabled future.\nAn Integrated Ecosystem Powering Circular Innovation ‘Upgrade & Protect’ is enabled by Basatne’s regional infrastructure, combining the power of Cartlow’s re-commerce and trade-in platform with Ardroid’s AI-powered reverse logistics engine. Together, they provide telcos with a complete circular framework, from seamless device collection and grading to resale, refurbishment, and responsible recycling.\nLikewize brings its global expertise to ensure scalability and telco readiness. Its risk-free operational model gives mobile operators access to a full turnkey solution with measurable economic returns and environmental impact.\n## **The Market Opportunity**\nThe GCC is primed for the shift to device-as-a-service models:\n  * Smartphone penetration exceeds **90%** across GCC markets.\n  * Handset replacement cycles average **12–18 months** , creating strong upgrade demand.\n  * The **global device subscription market is projected to exceed USD 25 billion by 2027**.\n  * By 2026, **5G adoption is expected to cover 73% of GCC mobile subscriptions**.\n  * The **regional smartphone market** is forecasted to grow from **60 million units in 2024 to nearly 99 million by 2033**.\n**“** Our partnership with Likewize marks a pivotal evolution in device ownership across the Middle East**,”** said **Mahmoud Abusway, Chief Commercial Officer of Basatne MENA**. _“By embedding circular economy principles into the telco model, ‘Upgrade & Protect’ delivers a flexible, sustainable solution that reduces waste, maximises asset value, and transforms the device lifecycle for both consumers and operators.”_\nWith this program, Basatne MENA and Likewize are setting a new benchmark for telecom innovation in the region, one that blends **sustainability, digitisation, and consumer empowerment**. ‘Upgrade & Protect’ is not just a service; it represents a shift in how the region thinks about technology ownership and circular value creation.\n## **About Basatne**\nBasatne is a global leader in circular technology, sustainable trade solutions, and reverse logistics, dedicated to reshaping the future of commerce.

It’s the **heartbeat** of our strategy, our innovation, and our promise to future generations. We live in a world where technology connects billions—but its silent cost is borne by the planet, the vulnerable, and the unborn.\n##  **A Planet Under Pressure**\nIn 2023 alone, the world generated over **61.3 million metric tons of electronic waste**. That’s more than the weight of every commercial aircraft ever built—discarded in a single year. Most of it ends up in the world’s poorest communities, poisoning soil, water, and people. Only **12.5%** is reused, repaired, or recycled properly. The rest? Burned. Buried. Forgotten.\n## This is not only an environmental issue, **it is a****geopolitical timebomb**.\n  * **90% of the world’s critical materials** are mined, processed, and controlled by China\n  * **40,000 children** mine cobalt in the Congo—under China-backed operations.\n  * **The rare earths we waste** are the same materials we need to build the next generation of technology, clean energy, semiconductors, and national defense systems.\nBy failing to recover what we’ve already mined, we are accelerating **conflict, dependence, and climate collapse**.\n### UN’s Global E-waste Monitor\nLearn more about e-waste and global inequality from the UN’s Global E-waste Monitor\n#### Circularity\n## The Most Underrated Climate Solution\nPeople talk about recycling, renewables, and electric vehicles—but **very few understand the raw power of reuse**.\nWhen we reuse a piece of technology instead of manufacturing new, we avoid **up to 90% of its embedded carbon emissions**. That includes emissions from mining, smelting, production, and shipping. That’s not just sustainability—it’s survival.\nNow, with legislation like the **European Green Deal** , and **California’s SB 253 and SB 261** , companies are finally being asked to account for their **Scope 3 emissions** —the ones buried deep in their supply chains. IT reuse is a direct, quantifiable way to reduce Scope 3. And yet, it's overlooked by most ESG programs.\n####  **ESG with a Human Face**.\n## **Behind every number is a person:**\nA **child** exposed to lead in an informal recycling pit in Ghana.\nA **factory worker** with no voice, assembling phones that will be obsolete in a few years.\nA **student** in Nairobi who can’t access school online because they lack a basic device.\n**Our work at Basatne changes that.**\n#### **Governance**\n## **Not Just Compliance, But Conscience**\n ISO 9001 Certified Quality management  ISO 14001 Certified Environmental management  ISO 27001 Certified Quality management  ISO 45001 Certified Health and safety management  R2v3 Certified Health and safety management  ADISA Certified Health and safety management ## SB\n253 Supports SB 253 Carbon emissions reporting ## SB\n261 Supports SB 261 Climate risk disclosure\nBut governance for us isn’t just about paperwork—it’s about **trust, integrity, and foresight**. When companies fail to manage technology EOL responsibly, they don’t just waste carbon—they risk **catastrophic data breaches** , **regulatory fines** , and **brand erosion**.\nMorgan Stanley learned that the hard way, paying **$163 million in penalties** for mishandling decommissioned data centers. That can be avoided—with the right partner, with the right vision.\n###  SB 253 & SB 261\nExplore SB 253 and SB 261 here\n## **Profit, Purpose, and the Future**\nWe are not asking companies to sacrifice **profit** for **purpose**. At Basatne, we show organizations how embracing circularity and sustainability in their IT lifecycle is not only ethical—but economically smart, operationally efficient, and reputationally powerful. Here’s how:\n### **1. Lowers Operating Costs**\nEvery asset you reuse is an asset you don’t need to replace.\n  * **Refurbishing** and extending the life of IT assets can reduce technology procurement costs by **25% to 40%** , especially for laptops, desktops, and mobile devices.\n  * **Proper decommissioning** and resale of old devices creates new revenue streams from assets that would otherwise be landfilled or incinerated.\n  * By avoiding traditional disposal and data destruction costs (which can be expensive and risky), companies gain more control over IT budget cycles.\n  * Efficient **asset recovery programs** can also reduce storage, transport, and warehousing costs.\n💡 _Example: A multinational telco saved over $2.5 million in CapEx by adopting a reuse-first lifecycle strategy—while simultaneously shrinking their carbon footprint by 2,400 metric tons CO₂e._\n### **2. Boosts ESG Scores**\nCircular IT practices directly improve ESG metrics across all three pillars:\n  * **Environmental** : Documented reuse reduces Scope 3 emissions, diverts toxic waste, and aligns with Net Zero targets and CSRD/SEC climate disclosure frameworks.\n  * **Social** : Donated or redistributed devices close the digital divide and support equitable access to technology in underserved communities.\n  * **Governance** : Demonstrates proactive data security, regulatory compliance (SB 253/SB 261), and supply chain responsibility—all valued by ESG ratings agencies.\nCompanies reporting on CDP, GRI, or SASB benefit from quantifiable, auditable circularity metrics, making their disclosures **more robust and investment-grade**.\n📘 _Explore how Scope 3 reuse boosts ESG scores via the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Standard_\n### **3. Opens New Global Markets**\nCircular technology unlocks business potential in regions that traditional tech distribution has ignored or underserved:\n  * **Emerging economies** in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America represent **billions of untapped consumers** —many of whom rely on affordable, reliable refurbished tech.\n  * By establishing **ethical refurbishing hubs** , companies create new job ecosystems and build brand affinity in fast-growing economies.\n  * ESG-aligned companies gain favor in public procurement bids, sustainability-driven partnerships, and NGO collaborations abroad.\n💡 _Insight: The World Bank estimates that increasing digital access in low-income countries by 10% can boost GDP by up to 2% annually. Tech reuse isn’t just good for the environment—it’s good for development._\n### **4. Builds Brand Trust**\nIn a world of greenwashing and digital fatigue, **trust is currency** —and circularity tells a story people believe in.\n  * **88% of consumers** say they prefer brands that help them live more sustainably.\n  * **Employees** are more likely to join and stay with companies that prioritize ESG—especially younger talent.\n  * **Investors and boards** increasingly demand transparency, authenticity, and action—not just pledges.\n  * Every reused device becomes a **proof point** that your brand walks the talk—on carbon, ethics, and digital equity.\n💡 _Morgan Stanley’s $163 million fine for mishandling EOL IT assets wasn’t just about compliance—it was a blow to their reputation. Proper ESG-focused lifecycle management isn’t just smart—it’s safe._\n88% of consumers want to align with sustainable brands. Investors are shifting billions into ESG-aligned portfolios. Regulators are catching up. And yet, the **biggest lever of impact—technology reuse—is still underutilized.\n‍**Basatne is changing that.\n## **A Personal Invitation**\nThis is about more than compliance. It’s about **legacy**.\nIt’s about standing at the intersection of climate, commerce, and conscience—and choosing to act.\n#### Build a Circular Future\n# Let’s Talk\nReach out to explore how we can reduce waste and elevate your ESG impact—together\nWe'll help you:\n  * Identify embedded carbon in your IT footprint\n  * Quantify and report avoided emissions\n  * Connect ESG metrics to IT and procurement decision-making\nBecause a better world isn’t just possible—it’s measurable.\nThank you!
