## What is E-waste ?
As per E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016.  
‘E-waste’ means electrical and electronic equipment, whole or in part discarded as waste by the consumer or bulk consumer as well as rejects from manufacturing, refurbishment and repair processes.
E-waste is a popular, informal name for electronic products nearing the end of their “useful life.” Computers, televisions, VCR’s, stereos, copiers, and fax machines are common electronic products. Many of these products can be reused, refurbished, or recycled.
![](https://trinityitrecycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-18-at-4.03.56%E2%80%AFPM-1024x477.png)

## E-waste Recycling
Once these materials were found, There was a need to test each E-waste component to see how long they lasted. As per the Study, the components lasted much longer than expected. Then It was concluded that this is a serious issue to the Environment and it has to be fixed in a proper way.
While this procedure is underway, There was a need to do more than throwing the things away. There exists the Recycling process and methods.

#### E-waste Recycling Process
