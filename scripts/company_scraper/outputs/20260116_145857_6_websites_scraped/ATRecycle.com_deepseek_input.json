The researchers split into teams and hospital officials presented them with about forty different medical devices. Do your worst, the researchers were instructed, and the results surprised even the experts, “They were all bad, really bad” said Billy Rios a former U.S. Marine and veteran of the war in Iraq. In the Marines, Rios worked in a signal intelligence unit and afterward took a position at the Defense Information Systems Agency and has since tinkered with weapons systems, aircraft components and even with the electrical grid… basically hacking into a public utility district in the state of Washington to illustrate potential risks and offer suggestions on how they might improve public safety.\n_Please note” The Mayo Clinic emerged from those sessions with a fresh set of security requirements for its medical device suppliers, requiring that each device be tested to meet standards before purchasing contracts were signed… the paragraph above was taken from a recent Bloomberg Business article._**_\n_**\n# URL: https://www.atrecycle.com/index.php/contact\n#  Contact Us\n#### Contact us toll-free at 877-781-7779 or complete the short form below to have us reach out to you.\nJoin our mailing list by [[clicking here]](http://eepurl.com/bYBUuv) and receive alerts for online deals, monthly auctions, and industry updates that will keep you informed and compliant.

Now these controls cover many products that are commercially manufactured for any military use.\nMany of these items were developed originally for military purposes but have evolved into mainstream commercial products – in the electronics navigation, computer security, maritime, aviation, and other industries.\n### ITAR Recycling Requirement List\nAt the core of the ITAR Requirements is a list of products called the U.S. Munitions List (“USML”). The USML contains a wide array of products as well as software, technical data, and services. If a company’s product, software, technical data, or services are identified on the list, the Government Agency or company is subject to the ITAR Requirements.\nThe USML contains twenty-one (21) broad categories of products or services. One of the broadest categories on the USML is Category XXI, a catch all which includes, any product, software, service, or technical data with substantial military capability that was designed, developed, configured, adapted or modified for military purposes.\nATR has established Secure Destruction Services (SDS) comprised of compliance, legal, logistics and operational professionals with additional capabilities and security clearances that identify and manage vulnerabilities in existing processes. The SDS team inspects commercial streams to locate anomalies such as hidden storage devices frequently missed by traditional processors who allow coexistence with residential e Waste materials. Additionally, we offer a complete line of destruction devices that can be deployed and used at the customers’ facilities when transportation to our secured facilities isn’t sufficient.\n### This list could include:\n  * Electronic system and computers designed, modified or configured for intelligence, security, or military purposes.\n  * Military training services and equipment.\n  * Drone Aircraft\n  * Command, control, and communications systems including radio (transceivers) and identification equipment.\n  * Navigation systems.\n  * Circuit boards\n  * And more\nThe Department of Defense has established specific protocols that must be followed to manage the disposal of Military Equipment and components no longer required or that equipment that has been deemed obsolete.\nThese waste streams fall under the ITAR (International Traffic and Arms Regulations) and ATR’s compliance team has developed a comprehensive program outlined in our IMS Policy and Procedures which is available upon request.\nOnly companies that are ITAR Registered can be utilized to process and provide the secure destruction for these assets. ATR offers fully compliant disposal options and use extensive monitoring and reporting for the USML Category XXI Equipment Disposal.\nMilitary Equipment is now being utilized by law enforcement agencies and it’s imperative ITAR disposal protocols be observed to ensure war gear and telecommunications equipment stays out of the hands of terrorists and criminals.\nATR has established Secure Destruction Services (SDS) comprised of compliance, legal, logistics, and operational professionals to create customized solutions. The SDS team manages Military Equipment/Components streams differently than traditional scrap processors who allow coexistence with residential E-Waste materials and do not segregate and inventory product.\nPer ITAR and R2v3 we have implemented a **ZERO** landfill policy for ITAR controlled materials where applicable, and we qualify each downstream vendor to ensure that all recoverable commodities remain on US Soil. ATR is authorized by the US State Department and Homeland Security to provide SDS (Secure Destruction Services) to highly volatile waste streams for Aerospace, Defense, and all Federal Agencies including the FBI, FAA, and US Border Patrol.\nATR also has a GSA Schedule that allows ATR to offer these same services and discounts to law enforcement and state agencies that require additional security.\nSince 2002, Advanced Technology Recycling (ATR) has provided a wide range of services and customizable solutions to our clients.

Customers have an opportunity to reduce fees with technology re-deployment and asset management while yielding a potential return on re- marketable equipment that has not reached obsolescence. In addition, customers have an opportunity to mitigate the risk associated with end-of-life electronic components and data bearing devices with an option of guaranteed physical destruction.\nBy allowing ATR to aid in strengthening the centralized program for equipment management, our customers will quickly realize positive results regarding waste reduction. As time progresses, our customers will see an improvement in three areas: Internal asset management controls, Cost savings with the re-deployment of assets and, a return from asset recovery efforts if applicable.\n### Re-deployment of our customers IT and Non-Traditional Equipment\nATR IT Services also provides options for redeployment of internal IT and nontraditional equipment within our customers facilities. This includes the re- deployment of non-traditional equipment/electronic components that have limited sales potential for re-market but can be beneficial for use at other our customers locations. These electronic equipment assets and components will be limited to what can be efficiently transported.\nUnder this program, ATR would offer a value-added IT service by cataloging our customers assets intended for redeployment and provide our customers with cost effective reverse logistics options. Once a facility expresses interest in a particular asset ATR will answer any questions related to transport and delivery options so the requester can make an informed decision.\n### Guaranteed Destruction Services for Proprietary Equipment\nATR can provide guaranteed destruction services for proprietary equipment and other prototypes/client parts/tools. Although large clients prefer destruction of their prototypes at a national-level, ATR can provide guaranteed destruction of equipment on a local or regional level as well. Because of ATR’s ITAR registration and compliance system, ATR has the resources and the trusted experience to manage the sensitive nature of this work for all types of industries.\n### Our customers acquisition/re-location/Asset Inventory Services\nWhile this program places a stronger emphasis on traditional recycling services (office electronics recycling, inventory management and data destruction), ATR would like to present our customers with project information regarding the consolidation, re-distribution, re-marketing and/or removing of assets associated with a company acquisitions and/or site closures and consolidations.\n### Data Destruction (Off-site – At ATR site)\nATR takes data security VERY seriously, sanitizing all re-marketable drives to NIST compliance standards. ATR understands that it may be a policy for our customers to wipe all hard drives/data-bearing devices before being release for recycling. ATR’s security policy is to initiate a wiping procedure for all re-marketable hard drives received, which can add an extra level of security to our customers current processes. If ATR receives a hard drive that has not been wiped internally by our customers, a report will be released to the appropriate contact person and the hard drive will be moved to a secure (locked) location pending instructions. For hard-drive units that are not re-marketable, ATR employs a guaranteed physical destruction method via the ATR shredder.\nFollowing the data destruction, ATR provides verification of this destruction back to the customer via real-time reports. Proof of destruction certification is readily available to clients through the web portal.\nThis certification, which complies with local, state, and federal guidelines, is available to view under the reports field option upon completion of data destruction. As mentioned, ATR is under 24/7/365 video surveillance and requires badge access for entry.\nAdditionally, ATR has the means to offer clients a live video feed into the facility should the client wish to witness the destruction of their data bearing devices or physical shredding of electronic components.\n### Data Destruction (Our Customers Site)\nListening to our client’s needs and requirements, ATR takes data security to the next level. ATR can provide service to our customers for a safe and secure internal method of data destruction by providing a mobile shredder for use at high-volume our customers IT Services hubs. This will allow the IT team at our customers to shred all the hard-drives utilizing a mobile hard- drive shredder within their department without having to leave our customers premises.\nATR will transport our mobile shredder to the desired location within 48 to 72 hours following the formal notification from our customers location requesting this service. After the hard drive destruction is completed and the shredder is packed in its transport crate, the facility Point of Contact will notify ATR to pick up the shredder and hard drive material. ATR will schedule a pickup and transport the shredder to another our customers location or to an ATR facility.\n### Reporting Metrics\nWith a strong IT infrastructure, ATR professionals have developed a comprehensive and easy-to-use client database that is available in real-time 24 hours a day/7 days a week. Through this web portal, clients can schedule, track, and view their shipments online, with the option to track equipment through the system by serial number. ATR has exclusively developed this client portal which can be customized to provide more applicable and detailed reporting mechanisms for our customers.\nThese equipment reports include certification of proper disposal (recycling), as well as information outlining the path each piece of equipment will take in the system (whether it is de-commissioned or repaired for re-market). ATR internally tracks the final disposition of units sold in the wholesale market, requiring downstream vendor accountability by only approving vendors that provide a responsible recycling solution for the electronics they receive.\n### Employee Purchase programs\nOne of the services ATR offers is an employee purchase program. ATR has overwhelming success offering this service to our partners. Below are some of the reasons outlining why this program has been so popular among clients:\n  * _No Liability or additional workload for our customers_ : ATR takes ownership of all equipment allocated to this program. ATR is responsible for fulfilling employee orders through the website, financial transactions, and help desk support for our customers employees who purchase equipment from the Employee Buyback\n  * _A great employee benefit_. Human Resources departments view the implementation of an Employee Buyback program as a benefit that will assist in employee self-enrichment. This program also provides a tool for employees and their families to acquire functioning, affordable computers at discounted prices.\nATR Asset recovery specialists and trained technicians carefully qualify each piece of equipment allocated for employee purchase programs. Following a NIST approved data wipe, eligible equipment is tested, repaired, and prepared for remarket to the R2v3 resale standards.\nATR’s 30 years of experience in IT solutions, allows us to work closely with our customers IT departments for the removal and secure transport of equipment to the new allocated location. ATR’s ability to provide this service allows clients to allocate their limited resources to focus on more crucial tasks involved in site relocation and/or acquisition activities.\nAdvanced Technology Recycling (ATR) is a division of B&K Technology Solutions. B&K Technology was formed in 1992 to offer businesses IT solutions to enable clients to be more competitive in their respective markets. The IT services that we continue to offer our partners today are:\nIT Asset Services\n  * Install / move / add / change equipment\n  * Physical Inventory\n  * Software audit and tracking services\n  * Hardware procurement / consulting services\n  * Equipment Relocation Services\n  * Site Closure and Logistics Services\n  * End of Lease Audit Services\n# URL: https://www.atrecycle.com/services/reverse-logistics\n#  Reverse Logistics\n# Reverse Logistics & e-Box Solutions\nATRs nationwide logistical services play a crucial role in establishing a secure chain of custody for your recyclable assets. White glove extractions and pickups are available anywhere in the US and we’ll track the entire route in real-time free of charge. ATR provides a wide range of services including secure logistics by utilizing a team of highly skilled professionals and a company owned fleet of vehicles. ATR logistics staff undergo considerable screening and are carefully vetted, maintain clean driving records and undergo annual reviews.\nATR currently operates a fleet of 57 vehicles ranging in size from cargo vans to box trucks with lift gates and long haul semis. We have a vehicle that will suit your needs and we’re continuously expanding our fleet. ATR vehicles are strategically stationed at our processing facilities throughout the U.S. and pickups can be scheduled through our online web portal.\n## What does this mean to our customers?\nIn addition to our company owned fleet, ATR has equipped every ATR vehicle with Geotab software. This software gives ATR the following abilities:\n  * To track our fleet of vehicles in real time\n  * Get alerts when our fleet arrives or departs a customer’s location\n  * Perform diagnostics on our fleet while they are in route\n  * Real-Time video feeds from vehicles cargo compartments and forward and aft cabin feeds.\n  * Re-Route our drives in the case of added pick-ups\n  * Maintaining compliance with the upcoming ELD mandate\nThis innovative software allows ATR to track the entire fleet of vehicles concurrently in real time 24/7 and capture detail rich reports. In the event that one of our trucks has a mechanical issue or they are delayed for any reason, ATR is able to contact our customers ahead of their scheduled pick-up time and inform them of the delay rather than waiting for the customers to contact us. This saves our customers time by allowing us to be proactive instead of reactive when a customer calls. ATR has the ability to set-up Geofences for our customers, which is an imaginary circle around a customers location and anytime an ATR vehicle enters or leaves that zone, an e-mail alert can be sent out notifying ATR and our customer of our arrival and of our departure. ATR drivers have been electronically logging hours of service since April of 2015 and they’re compliant with all ELD mandates.\n## What is the ATR difference?\nSecure Destruction customers can pre-order a detailed post-route map showing historical information like unscheduled delays, fuel stops, weigh station verification, speed and a detailed bread crumb trail of the actual route. If your shipment requires an escort ATR has a cost effective solution that gives you unprecedented access to our tracking system using an Internet enabled computer or mobile device . This route information can be captured and included with each BOL to provide an additional layer of transparency.\nEquipment transported by our fleet is extremely secure because all cargo doors are padlocked, trailers are sealed with unique transport IDs and the shipment is being monitored in real time to ensure that your ITAD equipment reaches our secure facilities undisturbed. If you need to be in total control of your next shipment ATR can put you in a virtual driver’s seat for a fraction of the cost of actually being there.\n## What if I just have a small amount of equipment?\nIn addition to our world class reverse logistics programs ATR also offers cost effective E-box solutions that can provide additional savings. Once a pickup request has been generated we’ll ship you a collapsed E-Box that you can fill with any combination of equipment listed on our accepted items list for a flat rate. Pick-ups can be scheduled online or give us a call and we’ll dispatch one of our pre-qualified LTL carriers to bring it back to one of our certified processing facilities.\n#### Rethink Electronic Recycling and Think ATR!\n# URL: https://www.atrecycle.com/services/traditional-recycling\n#  Traditional Recycling\n# Traditional Recycling & Commodity Recovery Programs – Maximize Value, Minimize Waste\nAdvanced Technology Recycling (ATR) offers modern traditional recycling and commodity recovery programs designed to help businesses turn their scrap and end-of-life materials into transparent, sustainable revenue streams.
