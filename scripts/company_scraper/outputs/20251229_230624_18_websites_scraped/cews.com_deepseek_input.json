The Tech for Good program provides refurbished laptops to low-income families, creates job opportunities, and promotes sustainability by reducing e-waste.\nThe Tech for Good program is CEWS’ flagship initiative that aims to bridge the digital divide and support underprivileged communities. By refurbishing used laptops, the program makes them accessible to low-income families who cannot afford to purchase new devices. The program also creates job opportunities for individuals who refurbish and distribute the laptops, providing them with skills and income to support themselves and their families. Additionally, the program helps reduce e-waste by repurposing used laptops that would otherwise end up in landfills.\nCEWS has partnered with the Alameda County Workforce Development Board, the Hayward Library, the Hayward Chamber of Commerce, Love Never Fails, 5 Pillars, DEV/Mission, Civic Corps Oakland, and Tech Exchange. These organizations bring unique expertise and resources to the Tech for Good program, enabling it to reach more people and create a greater impact in the community.\n“We are excited to partner with these organizations to expand our Tech for Good program and make a difference in the lives of more individuals and families,” said a CEWS spokesperson. “We are proud to work with organizations that share our vision of using technology for social good and promoting sustainability.”\nThe Tech for Good program has already provided refurbished laptops to many low-income families in the East Bay Area, enabling them to access educational resources, apply for jobs, and stay connected with their loved ones. The program has also created job opportunities for individuals who have faced barriers to employment, providing them with skills, income, and a sense of purpose.\n“The Tech for Good program is a prime example of how technology can be used to make a positive impact on our communities and our environment,” the CEWS spokesperson added. “We look forward to continuing to expand this program and create opportunities for more people in need.”\n\n================================================================================\n\n# URL: https://cews.com/contact\n\n# Contact Us\n## How May We Assist?\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n\n#### RESIDENTIAL E-WASTE RECYCLING\n* Local Drop-off Events\n* Fundraising Opportunities\n* Box It and Mail It Program\nFollow us on **Facebook** for current Drop-off dates, or drop at our **locations**.\n\n================================================================================\n\n# URL: https://cews.com/data-destruction\n\nE-WASTE DATA DESTRUCTION\n# Recycle Data-bearing Devices Risk-free\nCEWS offers complete chain-of-custody for risk protection during certified destruction operations.\n#### WE KEEP THE PROCESS SECURE\nContact a CEWS Expert\nThe threat of compromised data through electronic waste is a legitimate liability concern for any organization regardless of industry or scale.\n[](https://sustainableelectronics.org/)\n**Corporate eWaste Solutions (CEWS)** provides safe and effective management of confidential data on computers and other electronics, ensuring complete data destruction and chain of custody.

CEWS provides circular-economy solutions at scale.\n  * 70 Million Pounds in 2021 80% 80%\n  * 50 Million Pounds in 2020 75% 75%\n  * 9.5 Million Pounds in 2019 47% 47%\n  * Combined 12.3 Million Pounds in 2017-2018 35% 35%\n\n## Strict Zero Landfill Policy\nAt CEWS, We do not send electronic waste to landfills. Ever. In fact, it’s illegal.\nE-Waste that is sent to landfills or third-world countries for non-certified ‘burning’ allows for reckless contamination and lost opportunity of qualified materials repurposing. CEWS is a California approved and R2v3 Certified provider of reuse and recycling nationwide. Our recycling and removal processes involve using manual labour and machines to naturally recycle and reuse old hardware and assets.\nHIGH ETHICS MODEL\n### Certified Standards for All Process Streams\n\n#### Audit and Certification Policy\nCEWS maintains industry certifications to ensure our operations are following the most rigid safety and disposition guidelines. We continually seek to improve, train, and upgrade our standards ensuring our clients receive expert service.\n\n#### Down Stream Vendor Policy\nCEWS does not dispose of E-Waste components by shipping to third-world countries, intensifying toxic exposure to children (in cases of child labor) and to an already impoverished landscape due to the foreign practice of burning materials. \n## Complex Electronics Scrap Management\nCertified and proprietary processing technologies provide a legally safe means for E-Waste recycling into separated commodity units such as plastic, metal, and glass. \nOUR CONTINUING VISION\n### Expanding Capacity for Greater Scale & Outreach\nThe record level of global E‑Waste occurring annually is **equivalent to throwing out 1,000 laptops every second**[*].\nAt CEWS, we see more than E‑Waste. We see the potential of every recoverable and reuse item, from the lowest recycled commodity for our environment to a fully refurbished laptop for others.\n**CEWS is bridging the digital divide with E-Waste management to further education and career opportunities in local communities.**\nWe are excited to see cities and counties come together through our **Tech for Good** laptop program. By partnering with local organizations, residents in need are able to receive a fully refurbished laptop at no cost. **Learn more**.\n\nCEWS Operations\n  * 16 Partner Sites Nationwide\n  * 120,000 sq. ft.

Every smartphone upgrade, every laptop refresh, every server replacement adds to a growing mountain of e-waste that businesses need to handle responsibly. And honestly? The stakes couldn’t be higher.\nAt CEWS, we’ve seen firsthand how proper e-waste management has evolved from a simple disposal task into a critical business function. It’s not just about ticking compliance boxes anymore—it’s about protecting your brand reputation, keeping sensitive data secure, and showing stakeholders you’re serious about environmental responsibility.\n## **Standards Have Come a Long Way**\nThe electronics recycling industry has grown up a lot over the past decade. Gone are the days when “recycling” meant shipping containers overseas with little oversight. Today’s standards are sophisticated, comprehensive, and designed to actually protect what matters most—your business and our planet.\nTwo certifications lead the pack: R2v3 (Responsible Recycling Standard Version 3) and ISO 14001 environmental management certification. But here’s the thing—these aren’t just fancy certificates to hang on the wall. They’re comprehensive frameworks that ensure your e-waste partner can deliver the level of service your business actually needs.\n## **Why R2v3 Is a Game-Changer**\nThink of R2v3 as the electronics recycling industry’s answer to “how do we do this right?” It’s the latest version of the standard, and it addresses real problems that businesses face every day. We’re talking about robust environmental management, serious worker safety protocols, and—this is crucial—strict tracking of where every piece of equipment ends up.\nHere’s what makes R2v3 different: transparency isn’t optional anymore. Certified facilities have to track materials from the moment they arrive until their final destination. No more wondering if your old servers ended up in a landfill somewhere. No more crossing your fingers and hoping your recycler’s downstream partners meet your standards too.\nAnd let’s talk about data security for a minute. When you’re disposing of electronics, you’re not just getting rid of hardware—you’re dealing with potentially sensitive information. R2v3 takes this seriously, requiring comprehensive data destruction procedures and documentation. In a world where data breaches can cost millions and destroy reputations overnight, this isn’t just nice to have—it’s essential.\n## **ISO 14001: The Solid Foundation You Need**\nIf R2v3 is about doing recycling right, ISO 14001 is about building the foundation to keep doing it right, consistently. This internationally recognized standard isn’t just for recyclers—it’s used by companies worldwide to manage their environmental impact systematically.\nFor electronics recycling, ISO 14001 certification means your recycling partner isn’t just winging it. They have established systems for minimizing environmental impact while maximizing what can be recovered and reused. The standard’s focus on continuous improvement means they’re constantly looking for ways to do better—not just meeting minimum requirements.\nThe certification process involves rigorous third-party auditing and ongoing monitoring. Translation? You’re not just taking their word for it. Independent auditors regularly verify that environmental commitments are actually being met, giving you the confidence that your e-waste partner shares your commitment to doing right by the environment.\n## **What This Means for Your Business**\nIn today’s world, corporate sustainability reporting isn’t just for the annual report anymore—it’s become standard practice. Partnering with certified recyclers gives you the documentation and assurance you need to support ESG reporting requirements and demonstrate regulatory compliance without breaking a sweat.\nBut here’s the real value: these certifications are powerful risk management tools. By working with certified recyclers, you’re protecting your business from potential liabilities that come with improper e-waste disposal. We’re talking about regulatory penalties, environmental cleanup costs, and the kind of reputational damage that can take years to repair. The comprehensive tracking and documentation required by these standards give you the audit trail you need to show you did your due diligence.\n## **It’s About More Than Just Compliance**\nSmart companies know that responsible e-waste management goes way beyond just checking regulatory boxes. It’s about creating competitive advantage. When you partner with certified recyclers, you’re supporting your sustainability initiatives, enhancing your brand reputation, and showing stakeholders that environmental leadership isn’t just a talking point—it’s how you operate.\nThe circular economy principles built into R2v3 and ISO 14001 standards align perfectly with broader corporate sustainability strategies. This creates real opportunities for resource recovery and waste reduction that can deliver both environmental and economic benefits. It’s a win-win that makes good business sense.\n## **The Bottom Line**\nAs electronics recycling standards continue to evolve, certification is becoming more important, not less. At CEWS, our commitment to R2v3 and ISO 14001 certification reflects something we’ve learned over the years: responsible recycling requires more than good intentions—it demands rigorous standards, continuous improvement, and unwavering accountability.\nFor businesses dealing with e-waste, these certifications represent something invaluable: peace of mind. They provide assurance that your e-waste management aligns with your corporate values while meeting the highest standards of environmental responsibility and data security.\nThe future of electronics recycling isn’t just about processing more materials—it’s about processing them better. Certification standards like R2v3 and ISO 14001 provide the roadmap for getting there. And frankly, in today’s business environment, that’s not just smart—it’s essential.\n#### Recent Posts\n  * Small Actions, Big Impact: How Communities Can Reduce E-Waste\n  * Summer E-Waste Recycling: Why August is Your Golden Window for Electronic Cleanouts\n  * R2v3 & ISO Certification: Why Standards Matter More Than Ever in Electronics Recycling\n  * The Hidden Cost of Convenience: The Environmental Impact of E-Waste\n  * Electronics Recycling Leader Corporate eWaste Solutions (CEWS) Expands Sustainable Solutions in Phoenix and Kansas\n\n#### Recent Comments\n\n================================================================================\n\n# URL: https://cews.com/small-actions-big-impact-how-communities-can-reduce-e-waste\n\n# Small Actions, Big Impact: How Communities Can Reduce E-Waste\nSep 11, 2025 | Blog\n\nElectronic devices are an inseparable part of our daily lives—smartphones, laptops, TVs, kitchen gadgets, and more. But as technology evolves rapidly, so does the amount of discarded electronics, creating what we call electronic waste, or e-waste. According to the Global E-Waste Monitor, over 50 million metric tons of e-waste are generated worldwide each year, and only a fraction of it is properly recycled. The good news? Communities have the power to change this story. Small, collective actions can lead to significant impacts in reducing e-waste.\n### _**Why E-Waste Matters**_\nE-waste is not just about clutter in your home. Many devices contain toxic materials such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can harm both human health and the environment if not handled correctly. At the same time, electronics are packed with valuable resources like gold, copper, and rare earth elements that can be reused. Proper recycling prevents environmental damage and supports a circular economy.\n### _**How Corporate eWaste Solutions Can Help**_\nCorporate eWaste Solutions is committed to helping communities responsibly manage their electronic waste. By providing convenient collection, secure recycling, and educational resources, we make it easy for individuals, neighborhoods, and organizations to take part in reducing e-waste. Our programs ensure that valuable materials are recovered and toxic substances are safely disposed of.\n### _**Small Actions Communities Can Take**_\n**1. Organize Local E-Waste Collection Events**  \nCities and neighborhoods can collaborate with companies like Corporate eWaste Solutions or local governments to host regular e-waste drop-off events. These events make it easy for residents to responsibly dispose of unwanted electronics without extra hassle.\n**2. Promote Repair and Reuse**  \nInstead of throwing devices away, communities can encourage repair workshops or “fix-it” events where people bring broken gadgets and learn how to repair them. Donating working electronics to schools, non-profits, or families in need is another great way to extend their lifecycle.\n**3. Raise Awareness**  \nSimple campaigns—flyers, social media posts, or community newsletters—can go a long way in educating people about the dangers of e-waste and the importance of recycling. Many people don’t realize that throwing a phone in the trash has harmful consequences.\n**4. Support Local Recycling Centers**  \nCommunities can create directories of local e-waste drop-off points or recycling facilities and share them widely. Making recycling more accessible increases participation.\n**5. Encourage Sustainable Purchasing**  \nBuying less, choosing durable devices, or supporting companies with take-back programs all help reduce future e-waste. A community culture of mindful consumption can make a big difference over time.\n### _**The Ripple Effect**_\nWhen communities come together to tackle e-waste, the impact extends beyond just the environment. These efforts foster responsibility, encourage sustainability, and inspire future generations to be more mindful about technology use. A neighborhood e-waste drive, for example, not only diverts electronics from landfills but also sparks conversations about broader environmental issues.\n### _**Final Thoughts**_\nThe e-waste challenge may seem overwhelming, but small steps taken at the community level truly add up. By working together—through collection events, repair initiatives, education, and sustainable habits—communities can help turn the tide on electronic waste. Corporate eWaste Solutions is here to support these efforts, providing the tools and resources needed to make responsible e-waste management simple and effective. Remember: it doesn’t take massive change to make a big impact. Sometimes, the smallest actions are the ones that spark lasting transformation.\n#### Recent Posts\n  * Small Actions, Big Impact: How Communities Can Reduce E-Waste\n  * Summer E-Waste Recycling: Why August is Your Golden Window for Electronic Cleanouts\n  * R2v3 & ISO Certification: Why Standards Matter More Than Ever in Electronics Recycling\n  * The Hidden Cost of Convenience: The Environmental Impact of E-Waste\n  * Electronics Recycling Leader Corporate eWaste Solutions (CEWS) Expands Sustainable Solutions in Phoenix and Kansas\n\n#### Recent Comments\n\n================================================================================\n\n# URL: https://cews.com/solar-panel-recycling-services\n\n# **Recycling with CEWS**\nYour Solar Panel Recycling Experts\nWith the rapid growth of the solar industry, the need for proper disposal of damaged and end-of-life solar panels has become increasingly critical.

While many assume e-waste recycling follows the holiday electronics buying cycle, data reveals that summer months—particularly August—present the ideal window for corporate electronic cleanouts and recycling initiatives.\n### The Summer Surge: Understanding Seasonal E-Waste Patterns\nThe electronics industry follows predictable seasonal patterns that directly impact e-waste generation. Research shows that approximately 30% of total annual electronics sales occur during the Christmas holiday season, significantly higher than the average 19-20% for all retail categories.¹ However, this holiday purchasing surge creates a secondary effect: increased e-waste generation in late spring and early summer as consumers and businesses clear out older devices to make room for holiday acquisitions.\nCorporate IT refresh cycles add another layer to this seasonal pattern. Most organizations refresh significant portions of their technology fleet every three to four years, with the optimal refresh cycle for laptops and desktop computers consistently recommended at three years by total cost of ownership studies.² These refresh cycles often align with fiscal year planning, summer office moves, and back-to-school preparation periods.\n### Why Summer Makes Strategic Sense for E-Waste Management\n#### Corporate Timing Advantages\nSummer months align perfectly with corporate operational cycles. Many businesses use summer months for office relocations, infrastructure upgrades, and facility improvements. Companies planning moves, expansions, or acquisitions often find summer the optimal time to examine their technology needs and dispose of outdated equipment.³ This creates natural opportunities to combine major IT projects with responsible e-waste disposal.\n#### Budget Cycle Alignment\nFor many organizations, summer months represent the end of fiscal years, making it an ideal time to allocate remaining budget resources toward necessary IT infrastructure updates. Proactive planning during this period allows businesses to take advantage of bulk purchasing discounts and favorable financing options while properly disposing of replaced equipment.⁴\n#### Back-to-School Preparation Drives Activity\nThe back-to-school season creates significant waste generation spikes. Regional waste management data shows that trash and recycling volumes spike in August and September, comparable to holiday season increases.⁵ This isn’t just consumer-driven—educational institutions and businesses serving the education market often conduct major technology refreshes during summer months to prepare for the upcoming academic year.\n### The Stark Reality of Current E-Waste Management\nDespite these seasonal opportunities, global e-waste management remains alarmingly inadequate. The latest Global E-Waste Monitor reveals that electronic waste generation is rising five times faster than documented recycling efforts. In 2022, the world generated a record 62 million tonnes of e-waste, yet only 22.3% was documented as properly collected and recycled.⁶\nThis recycling rate is projected to drop further to 20% by 2030 due to the widening gap between recycling efforts and e-waste generation. The economic implications are staggering: $62 billion worth of recoverable natural resources goes unaccounted for annually, while less than 1% of rare earth element demand is met through e-waste recycling.⁷\n### Corporate Benefits of Summer E-Waste Initiatives\n#### Risk Management and Compliance\nSummer cleanouts provide businesses the opportunity to address data security risks before they become critical issues. Studies of used hard drives purchased from secondary markets reveal that 78% contain residual data, with 67% holding personally identifiable information and 11% containing corporate data.⁸ Scheduling proper e-waste disposal during summer maintenance windows allows for thorough data destruction protocols without disrupting peak business operations.\n#### Operational Efficiency Gains\nOrganizations that establish regular refresh cycles report significant productivity benefits. Research indicates that two out of three employees say outdated technology has the most significant impact on their productivity, with over 60% reporting that work-issued computers have prevented them from completing tasks.⁹ Summer refreshes position businesses for improved operational efficiency during busy fall and winter periods.\n#### Financial Optimization\nStrategic timing of e-waste disposal can provide financial benefits through asset recovery programs. Companies can potentially save 20% on initial acquisition costs through structured asset disposition programs, while refreshing PCs every three years reduces total cost of ownership by 24% compared to extended lifecycles.¹⁰\n### The Urgency for Action\nThe e-waste challenge will only intensify. Global e-waste generation increases by 2.6 million tonnes annually and is projected to reach 82 million tonnes by 2030—a 32% increase from 2022 levels.¹¹ With only 78 countries worldwide having electronic waste legislation in place, businesses cannot wait for regulatory solutions to emerge.\nFor forward-thinking organizations, summer 2025 represents more than just an operational window—it’s a strategic opportunity to demonstrate environmental leadership while optimizing technology infrastructure. The convergence of seasonal business cycles, budget planning periods, and operational timing makes summer the ideal season for comprehensive e-waste management initiatives.\nAs the electronics recycling industry continues to evolve and standards like R2v3 and ISO 14001 become increasingly important, businesses that establish proactive summer e-waste routines will find themselves better positioned for sustainable growth and regulatory compliance.\nThe question isn’t whether your business will need to address e-waste management—it’s whether you’ll take advantage of summer’s optimal timing to do it right.\nReferences:\n1. “Are there significant seasonal patterns in the electronics sector?” Investopedia, accessed July 2025.\n2. “The Importance of a PC Refresh Cycle,” Intel Corporation, accessed July 2025.\n3. “The Importance of IT Refresh Cycles,” CCB Technology, December 13, 2024.\n4. “Navigating the IT Equipment Refresh Cycle: Best Practices for Enterprises,” exIT Technologies, March 6, 2025.\n5. “How To Cut Back-To-School Waste,” CVWMA, August 16, 2024.\n6. “Global E-waste Monitor 2024: Electronic Waste Rising Five Times Faster than Documented E-waste Recycling,” United Nations Institute for Training and Research, March 20, 2024.\n7.

While technology makes life more efficient and connected, it also creates a silent but growing problem: electronic waste, or e-waste.\n### What Is E-Waste?\nE-waste refers to discarded electronic devices and components, including everything from outdated computers to broken headphones. As technology evolves rapidly, devices become obsolete faster, fueling a cycle of consumption and disposal.\nAccording to the **Global E-waste Monitor 2020** , the world generated over **53.6 million metric tons of e-waste** in 2019 alone, and this number is expected to continue rising.\n### Why Is E-Waste a Problem?\n  1. **Toxic Components**  \nMany electronic devices contain hazardous substances such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants. When not disposed of properly, these toxins can leach into the soil and groundwater, contaminating ecosystems and harming human health.\n  2. **Environmental Pollution**  \nImproper e-waste disposal, especially in informal recycling operations, often involves open-air burning or acid baths to extract valuable metals. These practices release harmful chemicals into the air, contributing to air pollution and climate change.\n  3. **Loss of Precious Resources**  \nElectronics are rich in valuable materials like gold, silver, copper, and rare earth metals. When devices are trashed instead of recycled, these finite resources are lost. Mining new materials to replace them exacerbates environmental degradation.\n  4. **E-Waste in Developing Countries**  \nMuch of the world’s e-waste is shipped to developing countries where environmental regulations are weak or poorly enforced. Workers, often including children, are exposed to dangerous conditions while trying to recover recyclable materials.\n\n### What Can We Do?\n  * **Extend the Lifespan of Devices** : Think twice before upgrading.

With cyber threats on the rise and data breaches becoming increasingly common, businesses must take proactive measures to ensure their confidential data remains secure—even at the end of its lifecycle. One crucial yet often overlooked aspect of data security is the proper disposal of old hard drives and electronic storage devices.\n**Why Data Security Matters**\nData security isn’t just about protecting your business from external threats; it’s also about maintaining trust with your customers, safeguarding proprietary information, and complying with regulations. A single data breach can result in:\n  * **Financial losses** : The average cost of a data breach in 2023 was $4.45 million globally.\n  * **Reputation damage** : Losing customer trust can have long-term consequences for your brand.\n  * **Legal penalties** : Failure to comply with data protection regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA can lead to hefty fines.\n\nSecurely disposing of obsolete storage devices is a vital part of any comprehensive data security strategy.\n**The Risks of Improper Disposal**\nSimply deleting files or reformatting a hard drive is not enough to protect sensitive information. Data can often be recovered from discarded devices using specialized tools, leaving your business vulnerable to breaches. Improper disposal methods such as dumping devices in landfills or recycling them without proper procedures can also lead to:\n  * **Data theft** : Cybercriminals can retrieve and exploit sensitive information.\n  * **Environmental harm** : E-waste contains hazardous materials that can pollute the environment if not handled responsibly.\n\n**Data Security for Everyday Users**\nData security isn’t just a concern for businesses—it’s equally important for individuals. Everyday users often store a wealth of personal information on their devices, including:\n  * **Financial information** : Bank account details, tax returns, and credit card numbers.\n  * **Personal data** : Photos, emails, and contact information.\n  * **Login credentials** : Passwords for online accounts and apps.\n\nImproperly disposing of personal devices like laptops, smartphones, or external hard drives can expose individuals to identity theft, financial fraud, and privacy breaches. Taking the following steps can help protect your personal data:\n  1. **Encrypt your data** before disposing of your device.\n  2. Use tools to **permanently wipe sensitive files** from storage.\n  3.

What was once a luxury has now become a necessity—integrated into every corner of our lives, both personal and professional. In today’s competitive world, the desire to stay current with the latest systems and devices fuels a fast-moving cycle of upgrades. But this progress comes with a hidden cost: an overwhelming rise in **electronic waste** , or **e-waste**.\n### **What Is E-Waste—And Why Should You Be Concerned?**\nE-waste is defined by the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) as “any unwanted electronic device or Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)” and is classified as _universal waste_. This includes everything from CRT televisions and flat-screen LCDs to laptops, smartphones, and desktop monitors. While these items may seem harmless once unplugged, they contain components that are highly toxic to the environment—materials like lead, mercury, cadmium, and flame retardants.\nAs technology evolves, so too does a troubling phenomenon: **planned obsolescence**. Many brands invest billions in marketing and product development strategies that intentionally shorten product lifespans, encouraging consumers to constantly upgrade to the newest model. This creates an unsustainable pattern of consumption, where perfectly functional devices are quickly discarded—becoming part of a growing mountain of global e-waste.\n### **The Global E-Waste Crisis**\nGlobally, we generate over **50 million metric tons** of e-waste each year, with that number expected to rise. Alarmingly, only a fraction is properly recycled. Much of it ends up in landfills, where toxic substances can leach into the soil and groundwater, or it’s shipped overseas to be dismantled in unsafe conditions, causing harm to both people and ecosystems.\nBut for corporations, there’s more at stake than just the environmental toll. Improper e-waste disposal can lead to data breaches, non-compliance with regulations, and reputational damage. That’s why secure, responsible recycling is no longer optional—it’s essential.\n### **Enter Corporate eWaste Solutions**\nThis is where **Corporate eWaste Solutions (CEWS)** steps in.
