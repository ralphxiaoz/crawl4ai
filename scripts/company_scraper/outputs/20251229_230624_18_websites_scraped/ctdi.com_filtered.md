# Procurement
## How to Do Business with CTDI
### CTDI Procurement Overview
CTDI is a full-service, global engineering, repair and logistics company providing best-cost solutions to the communications industry. As a global leader, CTDI offers a wide range of services and products to the major Telecom and Cable service providers and major OEMs from around the world. CTDI’s one-stop service commitment to customers has fueled the growth from a core business of equipment repair to include:
  * [ STB / CPE Division ](https://www.ctdi.com/services/stb-cpe/)
  * [ Mobile & Consumer Electronics Division ](https://www.ctdi.com/services/mobile-and-consumer-electronics/)
  * [ Network Services Division ](https://www.ctdi.com/services/network-services/)
  * Network Deployment Solutions Division
  * [ Product / Supply Division ](https://www.ctdi.com/services/product-supply/)


The CTDI Corporate Procurement organization is responsible for negotiating and contracting for goods and services for the CTDI Production areas. The supply chain is considered a strategic strength of our business and CTDI is constantly working towards continuous improvement in process performance and cost reduction. Improvements can be in the form of logistics improvements, process improvements, and material standardization and volume discounts for cost reductions.
### Procurement Practices
CTDI purchases a diverse selection of products and services each year. Electronics (both passive and active), packaging, telecommunications equipment, and supporting supplies and services comprise a major portion of these expenditures. CTDI purchases telecommunications equipment from various distributors and value-added resellers as well as from the original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s).
For non-production parts and material, CTDI purchases from a wide variety of suppliers based upon regional and company-wire efficiencies. Corporate Procurement makes effort to combine volumes and encourage standardization by utilizing corporate contracts to ensure the best possible cost is achieved for such supplies and services. Items purchased in volume are usually competitively bid to obtain volume discounts.
CTDI generally seeks out personnel to provide professional services such as programming, engineering, temporary personnel, through approved agencies. Corporate Procurement assists the Human Resources organization of CTDI to ensure competitive opportunities are provided at all times. Professionals are engaged directly only if they clearly meet the requirement for independent contractors under state and federal rules and regulations.
Contact the local CTDI facility in your area and ask for the person responsible for the purchasing at the branch. You may always contact the Corporate Procurement organization at the headquarters facility in West Chester, PA USA for additional information.
CTDI uses Purchase Orders for most expenditures. Assume you will need one when working with CTDI.

These values include providing exceptional service to our customers and operating with the highest standards of quality while valuing our employees and making a positive contribution to the communities in which we conduct business.

# Supplier Diversity
## Making Our Supply Chain Even Stronger!
At CTDI, we’re committed to doing business with minority, women, and veteran owned businesses as well as businesses who utilize people with disabilities because of our overall responsibility to the communities in which CTDI and its employees live. As it is also part of our customers’ commitment to support their business and communities, CTDI will proactively assist them in meeting this commitment. The objective of CTDI’s Supplier Diversity Program is to increase the amount of business awarded to minority, women, veteran and disabled-veteran owned businesses, as well as businesses who utilize people with disabilities by continually reviewing requirements for materials and services. CTDI has been a corporate member of the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) since 1995 and actively participates in the tech:SCALE Industry Group (previously known as TIG). CTDI is also a national corporate member of the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), the Women’s Business Enterprise Council – East and the Women’s Business Council Southwest (regional partner organizations of WBENC), as well as the National Veteran Business Development Council. In Canada, CTDI is a member of WBE Canada and the Canadian Aboriginal Minority Supplier Council (CAMSC).
### How to do Business with CTDI
CTDI provides support for diverse suppliers through direct initiatives and informal assistance. Our company is always seeking to improve the procurement process and upgrade our Supply Chain partners for continuous improvement in the company bottom line and in responsiveness to our customers.
Initial contact with potential suppliers may occur at the various Business Opportunity Fairs and Supplier Diversity events located throughout the United States and Canada. We encourage attendance at these events for greater networking opportunities with CTDI and our colleagues in the industry.
CTDI can be contacted either directly through the Supplier Diversity organization or through the Procurement Group. As Supplier Diversity is included in the Corporate Procurement Group, this information gets distributed quickly to those people active in the commodity/service areas.
We are always looking for companies who supply quality goods and services. No additional information other than contacting the Supplier Diversity organization with your diversity certificate at supplierdiversity@ctdi.com is necessary as CTDI does not use a separate portal – we prefer a more direct method.
If you qualify as a Diverse Supplier and have been certified by a third-party certifying body, additional support is available to you in identifying opportunities within CTDI from CTDI’s Supplier Diversity program (supplierdiversity@ctdi.com).
### Accepted third-party certifications include:
  * National Minority Supplier Development Council and regional affiliates
