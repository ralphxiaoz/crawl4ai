Recycling electronic waste could greatly reduce the need to constantly mine new materials for the creation of the latest devices.\n\nGem Lifecycle takes a holistic approach to IT Asset Management and Disposition – and by starting long before devices are ready for retirement – we do more than just resell and recycle outdated IT devices.\nWe can predictively and extemporaneously analyze the entire lifecycle value of each device to determine when and how to most cost-effectively and responsibly reuse, redeploy, resell, or recycle a device and its individual components – with absolutely nothing going to the landfill.\nAnd when we say, “each device,” we actually mean, “each and every device… and all its components.” From a datacenter filled with racks and drives, to a single laptop, to an individual chip, to the aluminum casing and copper wiring.\n**We ensure three things.**\n  1. That all data is handled and secured to the highest industry standards.\n  2. That all our clients receive maximum value.\n  3. That everything leaves our facilities ready to continue providing value.\n\n## We Can Help\n### No matter what your organization is or does.\n####  Telecommunications \n####  Data Centers \n####  Corporate IT \n####  Education \n####  Government \n## Keep It Out Of Landfills\nContact us today to responsibly dispose of electronic waste.\n Get A Quote \n  \nNavigation\n  *  Services \n  *  Sustainability \n  *  Industries \n  *  About Gem \n  *  Shop \n  *  Client Portal \n  *  R2 Equipment Categorization \n\nContact\n**Headquarters**  \n3950 Platinum Way  \nDallas, TX 75237\n**Other Locations »**\n**Phone:[(214) 333-5055](tel:214-333-5055)  \nEmail: infosw@gem.us.com**\n  \nAll Gem Lifecycle facilities are also certified by the industry’s leading third-party organizations.\n  * © 2025 GEM Lifecycle\n  *  Website design by OPTIX \n\nRequest A Quote Request A Quote\n\n================================================================================\n\n# URL: https://gemlifecycle.com/industries/schools\n\n Skip to content\n  \n Shop Now \n Portal Login \n## Education\n## What We Do\nThe world is constantly changing and keeping up to date on the newest information is only a click away when students have access to computers and tablets, but keeping students equipped with the latest technology can be a challenge.\nGem Lifecycle services numerous school districts and universities.
