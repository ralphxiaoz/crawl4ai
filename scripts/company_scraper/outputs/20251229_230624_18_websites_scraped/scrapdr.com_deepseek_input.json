For over twenty years, BCS Recycling Specialists Asset Management has been using an evolving, proprietary disassembly process that efficiently sorts and separates a wide range of electronic products.\nThe S3TM program consists of:\n  * Wire Stripping Process\n  * Disassembly Process\n  * Destruction Process\n  * CRT Glass to Glass Recycling Process\n\nSmart Sort and SeparationTM is integrated into our receiving procedures and repeatedly tested for effectiveness using quantifiable measures and delta analysis.\nThe S3TM program does not reject material unless it is below a 50% recovery, and maintains a 95% rate of efficiency.\n# CERTIFIED DESTRUCTION\nBCS Certified Destruction does exactly what the name implies. BCS provides destruction services for anything that needs to be destroyed, such as proprietary products, customer returns, damaged product, rejected product, RMA in house rejects, etc.\nBCS Recycling Specialists Asset Management owns and operates two 44 blade dual axle shredders, a plastic shredder, a regrind machine, and vertical balers that will meet our customer's destruction and recycling needs.\nProof of destruction can always be provided in the form of pictures, video, and certification documents. BCS customers are also free to witness destruction at the BCS HQ facility.\n\n### Reverse Logistics\n  * Recycle\n  * Re-use\n  * Repair\n  * Report\n\n### Navigate\n  * ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY\n  * PRIVACY POLICY\n  * TERMS OF SERVICE\n\n### Follow Us\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bcs-recycling-specialists/about/)\n  * [](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY7nW37VPgc5HjxafUofyRA)\n\n© 2019 built by Spotburner.com | All rights reserved.\nTOP\n\n================================================================================\n\n# URL: https://scrapdr.com/services/repair\n\n### REPAIR\nBCS Recycling is able to execute minor repairs in order to prepare products for reuse in almost any industry.

They take only the items that they perceive have value to them and the client is left with many goods that still need to be disposed of. \nOur philosophy is to take anything. Every company has surplus or excess, and we are able to solve that problem for them by processing these goods into a use-able product or turning it back into its commodity form.\n\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu4y9Hs3r7s)\n### What we look for\nBCS Recycling Specialists Asset Management is always in the market to purchase and service:\n  * clothing\n  * furniture\n  * appliances\n  * non-perishable goods\n  * end-of-life electronics (boards, drives, cards, computer equipment etc.)\n  * ink cartridges and toner\n  * excess and surplus inventory\n  * scrap and gold bearing scrap (PWBs, PWBAs, ICs, Metals, etc.)\n  * close out/going out of business material (phone systems, servers, computers, etc.)\n  * **Virtually any item!**\n\n### Reverse Logistics\n  * Recycle\n  * Re-use\n  * Repair\n  * Report\n\n### Navigate\n  * ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY\n  * PRIVACY POLICY\n  * TERMS OF SERVICE\n\n### Follow Us\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bcs-recycling-specialists/about/)\n  * [](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY7nW37VPgc5HjxafUofyRA)\n\n© 2019 built by Spotburner.com | All rights reserved.\nTOP\n\n================================================================================\n\n# URL: https://scrapdr.com/terms-of-service\n\n# Terms of Service\n1.
