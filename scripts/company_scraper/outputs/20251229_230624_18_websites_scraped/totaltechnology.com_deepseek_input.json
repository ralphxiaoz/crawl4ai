Data security will comply with the protocals in NIST 800-88. The National Institute of Standards in Technology is the benchmark in the industry. Total Technology also can wipe to DoD standards as well. All clients receive our standard data wipe and certificate of destruction free of charge. The security of your data is of utmost priority for us, as it is for you.\n\nSome companies require the hard drives or SSDs to be physically destroyed. Shredding will diminish the overall value of the device, but in some environments compliance requires it. Our partner network for destruction services maintain NAID AAA certifications. These services are primarily done onsite. Devices will not leave your site before storage components have been completely destroyed.\nWhat is R2V3?\nWhat is ISO?\n##### Consultative Approach\n### If data security concerns you and confuses  \nyou at the same time, we should talk.\n### Frequently Asked Questions\nCan you provide onsite data services? \nYes we can. Typically residual value of devices pays for this type of service\nDo you provide certificates of destruction and erasure? \nYes, we provide a certificate that covers specific serialized devices\nIs there a cost for data destruction services? \nIf you allow Total to resell the devices, the costs of data destruction is usually mitigated by the residual value of the device. \nIs NIST data erasure a Compliant data sanitization technique? \nFor most companies and agencies NIST is the standard, but we can erase to DoD standards as well. We can also destroy data to NAID standards, by physically shredding or destroying drives.\nIs there a minimum for onsite services? \nNo, but a service charge may apply to come on site. For small quantities it may not be financially prudent.\n### Contact Form\n\"*\" indicates required fields\nDo you want to learn about eWaste Compliance?\nThis website uses cookies to improve your experience.

I am guessing many companies have the same thoughts on new computers for their staff, but need to be financial prudent.\nWith the launch of new laptops with M2 chips, Computerworld wrote “In general, if you’re looking for a notebook to become your regular ride, for most users the M2 MacBook Air’s fanless design, fantastic battery life and clear bright screen — and its impressive performance per watt — add up to a machine you’ll use happily and productively for years.” the itch grows. Then I see the Independent ie say “Apple’s MacBook Air M2 is the best laptop around but costs a fortune.” The itch fades.\nTo be financially sustainable you have to make sure you (or your company) get high value for the devices you are currently using, when refreshing. The Apple ecosystem goes a long way to solve that issue. Simply said, MacBooks hold their value better than other laptops. After four years they hold about 40% of their original value. This value helps for future refreshes and keeps you (or your company) ahead of the curve when it comes to technology. M2 here I come! #Financiallysustainable #AppleM2 #totaltechnology\nThis website uses cookies to improve your experience.

If you could make having compliance also equate to having a financially sustainable technology program you would have a true win-win. Compliant Data Security and eWaste disposal can come with costs completely mitigated. At Total we strive to give you this outcome.\n\n## What Is Involved\n##### Comprehensive services that provide you with a quick and easy solution\nA sustainable technology program involves serveral interconnected services, but that doesn't mean the process needs to be complicated. Our process is founded in simplicity and transparency. from quote to compliance certification to settlement our consultants will act as a trusted guide.\nTechCycling™ Whether you are decommissioning a data center, refreshing some of your computer fleet, or something else we can find residual value for you. Learn more\nData destruction Data security is paramount to you and to us. Compliantly destroying data on decommissioned devices is the best way to protect your data from a breach. Learn more\neRecycling No one wants to take a toll on our planet. Take care of the planet with e-recycling for any devices that are at the end of their life. Learn more\nProgram logistics Chain of custody is a compliance often overlooked. Let us coordinate all of your device shipping needs to ensure compliance.

What is this \"IT\" we speak of? A data breach fine. Between those three alone, the fines amounted to over $745 million. The bottom line is companies that store personal information need to protect that data.\n_\"30% of all Data breaches come from not properly disposing of assets.\"_  \n– Gartner Research\nIf data security concerns you, you have come to the right place.\nAgain, if it can happen to companies like Target and Whole Foods... the \"IT\" this time are fines for improper disposal of eWaste. The fines aren’t as large as for a data breach, but they still can be in the millions. If your eWaste concerns you, you have come to the right place.\nThe common denominator for the two \"ITS\" are end of life technology. Let us be the solution to your problem before your concern becomes a reality.\n### Using Public Surplus or An Auction Site?\nPrior to sending your devices to public surplus, did you remove all assets tags and perform a DoD wipe? Even if you did, it can still go wrong. Most public surplus sites will not give you a serialized transfer of liability and do not vet the buyers as R2V3. Devices can still be identifiable to your company by the serial numbers via OEM records. You could still be on the hook for fines associated with improper e-waste disposal if your devices are discovered in a landfill. Today, these fines can be in the millions. With Total Technology and our R2V3 network, your compliance is assured, giving you peace of mind.\nData Security should also be a concern. Any data left on the device is exposed to whomever buys your auction lot. Selling devices with data on them without a contractual agreement to destroy the data puts your agency into a challenging and risk laden position (read data breach). With Total Technology, all data wiping is completed in accordance with NIST 800-88 (National Institute of Standard and Technology) or DOD (Department of Defense) standards.\nThis website uses cookies to improve your experience.

Items that do not fit the ready for re-use or ready for repair models are sent for proper recycling. Recycling a device to its core reusable components is vital to the health of our planet.\nWhat is R2V3?\n### The Truth about eWaste\n  * eWaste represents two percent of America’s trash in landfills but equals 70 percent of overall toxic waste.\n  * Annually, 20 to 50 million metric tons of eWaste are disposed of worldwide.\n  * The United States produces more eWaste than any other country, producing nearly 9 million tons each year.\n  * 80 percent of eWaste is not documented.\n\n  * Only 12.5 percent of eWaste is recycled.\n  * For every one million cell phones that are recycled, 35,274 pounds of copper, 772 pounds of silver, 75 pounds of gold, and 33 pounds of palladium can be recovered.\n  * Only 29 percent of EWaste is handled by best practice recycling channels.\n  * Over 152 million cell phones are thrown away each year.\n\n##### Learn what you can do.\n### If your planet and the effect eWaste  \nhas on it concerns you , we should talk.\n### Frequently Asked Questions\nDoes Total Technology hold the R2V3 Certification? \nYes!\nLearn More\nDo recycling services cost money? \nIt depends on the device itself. The material components of an item often have value that exceeds the cost of recycling, so value can be given back to the company.\nDo you provide certificates of recycling? \nYes, we can provide a certificate that covers a manifest list of the items recycled.\nAre all devices recycled? \nWe prefer TechCycling devices first to repurpose the device completely or the components of it. Only when a device has no value to we use our vetted partner network to recycle a device to its core material components.\n### Contact Form\n\"*\" indicates required fields\nDo you want to learn about Data Security Compliance?\nThis website uses cookies to improve your experience.

The question then becomes: What do I do with my outdated tech devices? As you decide to retire your older technology such as laptops, tablets, mobile phones, servers, and networking equipment, getting the maximum value for the devices is prudent. Ensuring any data on these devices are erased or destroyed is equally important. Finally, if any equipment needs to be recycled, making sure eWaste is handled according to environmentally acceptable standards is vital. All of these service components are interconnected. If you are looking for a partner to help make this process simple, you have come to the right place!\n\n## What We Offer\nTechCycling™ | Data destruction | eRecycling | Program logistics | Deployment Services\n\n### TechCycling™\nThe backbone of our TechCycling™ services is innovative technology. Whether it's using our analytic software to provide a quick yet accurate quote or building a custom platform to automate the receipt of thousands of individual shipments or employing AI to predict the value of an OEM's devices years out, we use technology to maximize the value of your end-of-life tech. We are more than just a company that disposes of your decommissioned technology. Our TechCycling™ services are the key to getting you the highest value and running a financially sustainable technology program.\n### Data destruction\nSometimes protecting your data means destroying it. With fines associated in data breach increasing, it is more important than ever to destroy the data properly when decommissioning devices.\n\"30% of all Data breaches come from not properly disposing of assets.\"  \n-Gartner Research\nFines can be in the millions. There are many effective methods for destroying data that comply with NIST or DOD standards. Whether you choose On or Off site hard drive shredding, hard drive erasure, or hard drive degaussing, you can be sure your data is securely destroyed.\n\n### eRecycling\nWhen a device owned by your company makes its way to a landfill, bad outcomes for your company could be on the horizon: especially if those devices were asset tagged. Companies like Target or Whole Foods have been hit by fines for improperly disposing of eWaste. Taking appropriate measures with your eWaste should be a priority. Our eRecycling partner network consists of R2V3 (Responsible Recycling) certified companies ensuring your devices never make their way to a landfill.\n### Program logistics\nLogistics can be a weak link in the chain, but it doesn't have to be. Complete chain of custody may be paramount to you in your decision making process when choosing a service provider. From GPS tracking, to secure logistics, to box programs, to white glove logistics solutions, Total Technology's partner network and in-house solutions add layers of security and ease to your project.\n\n### Deployment Services\nRolling out new devices can strain your internal resources. Total Technology's Deployment Services offer a seamless, end-to-end solution to ease that burden. From asset tagging and serial number logging to device casing and secure delivery to remote sites, we offer a comprehensive solution that takes the stress out of deploying new technology. If there's a service you need that isn't listed, please ask—we're here to meet all your deployment needs.\n### Serving our customers as an ITAD company\nAs a core function, an ITAD company expands the life of technology. We only recycle the technology we receive when the device is at true end of life. ITAD stands for IT Asset Disposition, but an ITAD company needs to be an expert at many things to fulfill the needs of its customers. That is why we offer secure data sanitization, a box program for remote workers, and the ability to recycle devices to their core components in addition to our device buyback program.\n### How our expertise can assist you\n##### Each client has a unique set of challenges and goals, and our  \nchannel expertise allows us to establish a fitting plan for you\n[](https://totaltechnology.com/enterprise-or-corporate/)\n[](https://totaltechnology.com/k12/)\n[](https://totaltechnology.com/government/)\n[](https://totaltechnology.com/healthcare/)\n[](https://totaltechnology.com/non-profit/)\n### Talk to us about a solution\n##### Learn how we can apply our consultative approach to find the right solution for you\nSee how we can help\nThis website uses cookies to improve your experience.

Not always. When a device is recycled a new device typically takes its place. So, new materials are used to create the new device to fill the void. With TechCycling you repurpose a device or it’s components. No net gain of a new device is necessary. Recycling is good, TechCycling is better. At Total Technology we do both, but prefer the TechCycling option.\nTechCycling also has broader benefits. Having your devices repurposed is a more financially sustainable choice. Most devices have a value and that value is returned to you to put toward future deployments. When TechCycling you still have compliance when it comes to data security. The process is truly win, win. \nThis website uses cookies to improve your experience.
