# R2V3 Certification
##### Our commitment to safety, security, and sustainability
![Computers Image](https://totaltechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/computers-image.png)
## What is an R2V3 Certification?
##### Safe and responsible electronic disposal
The R2V3 Certification is a globally recognized voluntary standard that ensures responsible recycling and sustainable management of electronic waste. This certification requires companies to adhere to rigorous environmental, health, and safety practices, ensuring that data destruction is secure, electronics with remaining value are effectively reused, and hazardous materials are managed in ways that minimize environmental impact. 
![Data Destruction Image Large](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20728%20698'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
## What Does an R2V3 Certification Mean for Total Technology?
##### A partnership for a healthier planet
Our R2V3 certification reflects our dedication to safeguarding your interests and the environment. Adhering to the highest standards in e-waste recycling, we:
  * Follow strict data destruction protocols to protect your company’s sensitive information
  * Reuse and maximize electronics with residual value to reduce the environmental impact
  * Reduce unnecessary waste by preventing your assets from ending up in landfills
  * Prevent your electronics from being exported to countries with weak environmental protections


At Total Technology, we’re committed to partnering with you to improve sustainability throughout the supply chain, while ensuring your data is secure.
[Learn More About Data Security](https://totaltechnology.com/data-security/)
## What are ISO Standards?
##### The foundation for responsible companies
To achieve R2V3 certification, companies must first meet specific ISO standards. These standards lay the foundation for a comprehensive recycling approach that includes environmental, health, safety, and quality management.

##### Environmental Responsibility

# Navigating Data Security
##### Your Compliance, Our Responsibility
![Navigating Data Security banner](https://totaltechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/computers-image.png)
If you choose data erasure as your security technique, your devices will hold their value to a greater degree and still have the security you require. Data security will comply with the protocals in NIST 800-88. The National Institute of Standards in Technology is the benchmark in the industry. Total Technology also can wipe to DoD standards as well. All clients receive our standard data wipe and certificate of destruction free of charge. The security of your data is of utmost priority for us, as it is for you.
![Data Destruction Image](https://totaltechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/data-destruction-image.png)
Some companies require the hard drives or SSDs to be physically destroyed. Shredding will diminish the overall value of the device, but in some environments compliance requires it. Our partner network for destruction services maintain NAID AAA certifications. These services are primarily done onsite. Devices will not leave your site before storage components have been completely destroyed.
[What is R2V3?](https://totaltechnology.com/certifications/)
[What is ISO?](https://totaltechnology.com/certifications/)
##### Consultative Approach
### If data security concerns you and confuses  
you at the same time, we should talk.
### Frequently Asked Questions
Can you provide onsite data services? 
Yes we can. Typically residual value of devices pays for this type of service
Do you provide certificates of destruction and erasure? 
Yes, we provide a certificate that covers specific serialized devices
Is there a cost for data destruction services? 
If you allow Total to resell the devices, the costs of data destruction is usually mitigated by the residual value of the device. 
Is NIST data erasure a Compliant data sanitization technique? 
For most companies and agencies NIST is the standard, but we can erase to DoD standards as well. We can also destroy data to NAID standards, by physically shredding or destroying drives.
Is there a minimum for onsite services? 
No, but a service charge may apply to come on site. For small quantities it may not be financially prudent.

Every time Apple announces a new MacBook I look at my current MacBook and think “we’ve had a good run my friend.” But usually don’t end up pulling the trigger on plopping down my credit card. I am guessing many companies have the same thoughts on new computers for their staff, but need to be financial prudent.
With the launch of new laptops with M2 chips, [Computerworld](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3668249/review-apples-m2-macbook-air.html) wrote “In general, if you’re looking for a notebook to become your regular ride, for most users the M2 MacBook Air’s fanless design, fantastic battery life and clear bright screen — and its impressive performance per watt — add up to a machine you’ll use happily and productively for years.” the itch grows. Then I see the [Independent ie](https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/review-apples-macbook-air-m2-is-the-best-laptop-around-but-costs-a-fortune-41863788.html) say “Apple’s MacBook Air M2 is the best laptop around but costs a fortune.” The itch fades.
To be financially sustainable you have to make sure you (or your company) get high value for the devices you are currently using, when refreshing. The Apple ecosystem goes a long way to solve that issue. Simply said, MacBooks hold their value better than other laptops. After four years they hold about 40% of their original value. This value helps for future refreshes and keeps you (or your company) ahead of the curve when it comes to technology. M2 here I come! #Financiallysustainable #AppleM2 #totaltechnology

###### Repurpose
Devices are then refurbished and remarketed or recycled if the device is truly end of life.
##### Data Security and eWaste Disposal - Should you be concerned?
If it can happen to companies like Marriott, Uber, and Equifax, it can happen to you. What is this "IT" we speak of? A data breach fine. Between those three alone, the fines amounted to over $745 million. The bottom line is companies that store personal information need to protect that data.
_"30% of all Data breaches come from not properly disposing of assets."_  
– Gartner Research
If data security concerns you, you have come to the right place.
Again, if it can happen to companies like Target and Whole Foods... the "IT" this time are fines for improper disposal of eWaste. The fines aren’t as large as for a data breach, but they still can be in the millions. If your eWaste concerns you, you have come to the right place.
The common denominator for the two "ITS" are end of life technology. Let us be the solution to your problem before your concern becomes a reality.
### Using Public Surplus or An Auction Site?
Prior to sending your devices to public surplus, did you remove all assets tags and perform a DoD wipe? Even if you did, it can still go wrong. Most public surplus sites will not give you a serialized transfer of liability and do not vet the buyers as R2V3. Devices can still be identifiable to your company by the serial numbers via OEM records. You could still be on the hook for fines associated with improper e-waste disposal if your devices are discovered in a landfill. Today, these fines can be in the millions. With Total Technology and our R2V3 network, your compliance is assured, giving you peace of mind.
Data Security should also be a concern. Any data left on the device is exposed to whomever buys your auction lot. Selling devices with data on them without a contractual agreement to destroy the data puts your agency into a challenging and risk laden position (read data breach). With Total Technology, all data wiping is completed in accordance with NIST 800-88 (National Institute of Standard and Technology) or DOD (Department of Defense) standards.

# eWaste Compliance
#### The Gold Standard
![eWaste Compliance](https://totaltechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/computers-image.png)
## Our World, Our Responsibility
Total Technology's recycling partner network consists exclusively R2V3 Certified recyclers. By partnering with these gold standard recycling facilities, you can be assured of sustainability throughout the recycling chain. Items that do not fit the ready for re-use or ready for repair models are sent for proper recycling. Recycling a device to its core reusable components is vital to the health of our planet.
[What is R2V3?](https://totaltechnology.com/certifications/)
### The Truth about eWaste
  * eWaste represents two percent of America’s trash in landfills but equals 70 percent of overall toxic waste.
  * Annually, 20 to 50 million metric tons of eWaste are disposed of worldwide.
  * The United States produces more eWaste than any other country, producing nearly 9 million tons each year.
  * 80 percent of eWaste is not documented.


  * Only 12.5 percent of eWaste is recycled.
  * For every one million cell phones that are recycled, 35,274 pounds of copper, 772 pounds of silver, 75 pounds of gold, and 33 pounds of palladium can be recovered.
  * Only 29 percent of EWaste is handled by best practice recycling channels.
  * Over 152 million cell phones are thrown away each year.


##### Learn what you can do.
### If your planet and the effect eWaste  
has on it concerns you , we should talk.
### Frequently Asked Questions
Does Total Technology hold the R2V3 Certification? 
Yes!
[Learn More](https://totaltechnology.com/certifications/)
Do recycling services cost money? 
It depends on the device itself. The material components of an item often have value that exceeds the cost of recycling, so value can be given back to the company.
Do you provide certificates of recycling? 
Yes, we can provide a certificate that covers a manifest list of the items recycled.
Are all devices recycled? 
We prefer TechCycling devices first to repurpose the device completely or the components of it. Only when a device has no value to we use our vetted partner network to recycle a device to its core material components.

# I’m having Deja Vu all over again!

![I’m having Deja Vu all over again!](https://totaltechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/TB12-Tablet-throw.jpg)
Clearly, tablets aren’t the cause of poor quarterback play, but good old Tom Brady regularly takes his frustrations out on his Surface. #Buccaneers, you do realize Tom is killing the residual value of your Surfaces right?
To the other NFL teams, we will gladly purchase your end-of-use tablets. See how strong Tom’s arm is off the field here at [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/18/23359755/tom-brady-microsoft-surface-tablet-tampa-bay-buccaneers-saints-football-nfl)

### LeaseRelease - Lease Buyout Done Right
Total Technology’s lease buyout program allows a school to pull forward their device refresh by using the current buyback value of the school’s devices to pay off their remaining lease balance. This allows schools to get into their new devices a year early, and capitalize on the peak residual value of their used technologies. Qualified customers will receive an advance buyback payment equal to their remaining lease balance, removing the risk of a budget shortfall on your next refresh. Getting started is simple - please complete the below form, and a member of our team will be in touch shortly.

# Our Story
![Our story hero](https://totaltechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/our-story-image.png)
## The Story Of Total Technology
##### Technology Based Customer Solutions
Having Technology in our name wasn’t by accident. Yes, we deal in technology every day, but how we USE technology to enhance customer experience is key. Our technology-based solutions allow us to scale, improve responsiveness, provide a completely digital experience, build cost-effective methods for internal processes, and streamline project management.
How you may ask? Many ways, and here are a few. We use proprietary analytics software to determine the value of technology for OEM lease programs. In returns management, we automate reporting which leads to complete transparency and a quicker turnaround from pickup to payout. Our technological approach includes creating platforms to assist our customers in collecting laptops, tablets, and desktops back from their employees in a way scalable to thousands of individual shipments. Our software solutions allow us to track data compliances down to individual serial numbers in many cases. Each solution optimizes the customer experience. Whether you are an enterprise that needs a data center decommissioned, a school district that needs a high valuation for a fleet of iPads, or a municipality in search of a smooth contractual experience, Total Technology has your seamless technology-driven solution.
### Our Service Goals
##### We place an emphasis on the importance of privacy, security, and sustainability
![](https://totaltechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/investment-icon.svg) Maximizing your investment 
![](https://totaltechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/protecting-icon.svg) Protecting your data 
![](https://totaltechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/arrows-icon.svg) Securing Your Logistics 
![](https://totaltechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/preserving-icon.svg) Preserving the planet 
Being sustainable is a key. Your internal technology plan needs to be financially sustainable.  
By offering a high value for your end of life equipment we help your company be just that  
allowing you to keep on the front edge of ever changing technology.
Sometimes protecting your data means destroying it. With fines associated to a data breach increasing, it is  
more important than ever to destroy the data properly when decommissioning devices.
"30% of all Data breaches come from not properly disposing of assets."  
-Gartner Research
Logistics can be a weak link in the chain, but it doesn't have to be. Complete chain of custody may be  
paramount to you in your decision making process. From GPS tracking, to secure logistics, to box  
programs, to white glove logistics solutions, Total Technology's partner network and in-house solutions  
add layers of security and ease to your project.
Extending the functional life of technology is our mission, but when a device is truly end-of-life we turn to  
our eRecycling partner network that consists of R2V3 certified companies ensuring your devices do not  
make their way to a landfill. Instead devices are recycled to their core components.
### Meet The Team
##### Focused on your needs and our philosophy with everything we do
We find it true that a company is only as good as its people. As our bedrock, we are fortunate to have very good people at Total Technology: People who care about the experience of our customers, vendors, and partners. Michael Taghavi, our CEO, first and foremost looks for a company culture fit when hiring. Yes, character counts. From our repair technicians to our field operations personnel to our customer service crew, you will find the type of person you too would enjoy working with.
To provide a great experience for our customers we have assembled a best-in-class team. This group has the experience required to make your project run smoothly and have your desired outcome.

# Our Services

## A sustainable, Comprehensive  
Solution For Your Outdated Devices
##### Striving to expand the life of your technology
To ensure the maximum productivity of your team, keeping up with ever changing technology is crucial. The question then becomes: What do I do with my outdated tech devices? As you decide to retire your older technology such as laptops, tablets, mobile phones, servers, and networking equipment, getting the maximum value for the devices is prudent. Ensuring any data on these devices are erased or destroyed is equally important. Finally, if any equipment needs to be recycled, making sure eWaste is handled according to environmentally acceptable standards is vital. All of these service components are interconnected. If you are looking for a partner to help make this process simple, you have come to the right place!
![Double Down Arrow](https://totaltechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/double-down-arrow.svg)
## What We Offer
[TechCycling™](https://totaltechnology.com/services/#device-buyback) | [Data destruction](https://totaltechnology.com/services/#data-destruction) | [eRecycling](https://totaltechnology.com/services/#erecycling) | [Program logistics](https://totaltechnology.com/services/#program-logistics) | [Deployment Services](https://totaltechnology.com/services/#deployment-services)
![TechCycling™](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201010%20820'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
### TechCycling™
The backbone of our TechCycling™ services is innovative technology. Whether it's using our analytic software to provide a quick yet accurate quote or building a custom platform to automate the receipt of thousands of individual shipments or employing AI to predict the value of an OEM's devices years out, we use technology to maximize the value of your end-of-life tech. We are more than just a company that disposes of your decommissioned technology. Our TechCycling™ services are the key to getting you the highest value and running a financially sustainable technology program.
### Data destruction
Sometimes protecting your data means destroying it. With fines associated in data breach increasing, it is more important than ever to destroy the data properly when decommissioning devices.
"30% of all Data breaches come from not properly disposing of assets."  
-Gartner Research
Fines can be in the millions. There are many effective methods for destroying data that comply with NIST or DOD standards. Whether you choose On or Off site hard drive shredding, hard drive erasure, or hard drive degaussing, you can be sure your data is securely destroyed.
![Data destruction](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20728%20698'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
![eRecycling](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20232%20354'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
### eRecycling
When a device owned by your company makes its way to a landfill, bad outcomes for your company could be on the horizon: especially if those devices were asset tagged. Companies like Target or Whole Foods have been hit by fines for improperly disposing of eWaste. Taking appropriate measures with your eWaste should be a priority. Our eRecycling partner network consists of R2V3 (Responsible Recycling) certified companies ensuring your devices never make their way to a landfill.
### Program logistics
Logistics can be a weak link in the chain, but it doesn't have to be. Complete chain of custody may be paramount to you in your decision making process when choosing a service provider. From GPS tracking, to secure logistics, to box programs, to white glove logistics solutions, Total Technology's partner network and in-house solutions add layers of security and ease to your project.
![Program logistics](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20766%20714'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

### Deployment Services
Rolling out new devices can strain your internal resources. Total Technology's Deployment Services offer a seamless, end-to-end solution to ease that burden. From asset tagging and serial number logging to device casing and secure delivery to remote sites, we offer a comprehensive solution that takes the stress out of deploying new technology. If there's a service you need that isn't listed, please ask—we're here to meet all your deployment needs.
### Serving our customers as an ITAD company
As a core function, an ITAD company expands the life of technology. We only recycle the technology we receive when the device is at true end of life. ITAD stands for IT Asset Disposition, but an ITAD company needs to be an expert at many things to fulfill the needs of its customers. That is why we offer secure data sanitization, a box program for remote workers, and the ability to recycle devices to their core components in addition to our device buyback program.

# What is TechCycling?
April 19, 2022
![What is TechCycling?](https://totaltechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iStock-1263055085-copy.png)
Is recycling the best thing to do for the environment? Not always. When a device is recycled a new device typically takes its place. So, new materials are used to create the new device to fill the void. With TechCycling you repurpose a device or it’s components. No net gain of a new device is necessary. Recycling is good, TechCycling is better. At Total Technology we do both, but prefer the TechCycling option.
TechCycling also has broader benefits. Having your devices repurposed is a more financially sustainable choice. Most devices have a value and that value is returned to you to put toward future deployments. When TechCycling you still have compliance when it comes to data security. The process is truly win, win.
