### RECYCLE
# What is recycling?
Recycling is very simple. We break everything down into its commodity value, we get the most value out of it and then we report on it.We ensure that everything is disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner and always strive to maximize landfill diversion.
Every company has surplus, returns or excess inventory and we have developed a solution to solve that need. We are proud of our national footprint, which gives us the ability to service clients anywhere in the country within 24 hours and that is why some of the biggest companies in the nation trust us.

# S3TM - SMART SORT AND SEPARATIONTM
When recycling electronic waste each disassembly process is unique to the product that is recycled. For over twenty years, BCS Recycling Specialists Asset Management has been using an evolving, proprietary disassembly process that efficiently sorts and separates a wide range of electronic products.
The S3TM program consists of:
  * Wire Stripping Process
  * Disassembly Process
  * Destruction Process
  * CRT Glass to Glass Recycling Process


Smart Sort and SeparationTM is integrated into our receiving procedures and repeatedly tested for effectiveness using quantifiable measures and delta analysis.
The S3TM program does not reject material unless it is below a 50% recovery, and maintains a 95% rate of efficiency.
# CERTIFIED DESTRUCTION
BCS Certified Destruction does exactly what the name implies. BCS provides destruction services for anything that needs to be destroyed, such as proprietary products, customer returns, damaged product, rejected product, RMA in house rejects, etc.
BCS Recycling Specialists Asset Management owns and operates two 44 blade dual axle shredders, a plastic shredder, a regrind machine, and vertical balers that will meet our customer's destruction and recycling needs.
Proof of destruction can always be provided in the form of pictures, video, and certification documents. BCS customers are also free to witness destruction at the BCS HQ facility.

### RE-USE
### How it works
There are many companies out there that will buy excess inventory, but they are not solving their customer's problems. They take only the items that they perceive have value to them and the client is left with many goods that still need to be disposed of. 
Our philosophy is to take anything. Every company has surplus or excess, and we are able to solve that problem for them by processing these goods into a use-able product or turning it back into its commodity form.
