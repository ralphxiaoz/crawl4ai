Check that all keys and buttons are functional and that the trackpad is responsive.\n#### Check Housing\nMinor scratches are considered normal wear and tear, but cracks and severe dents to the housing are considered damage.\n## get in touch\n  *   \nRoseville, CA 95678\n  * [](tel:+19167355966)\n  * \n\nExplore\n  * Mac sale\n  * Mac Repair\n  * Mac Parts\n  * Sell your Mac\n  * Mac Support\n\nProducts\n  * MacBook Pro\n  * MacBook Air\n  * iMac\n  * Mac Mini\n\nOther Stuff\n  * LiquidationComing soon\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Returns & Refunds\n  * Pickup & Delivery\n\nNeve | Powered by WordPress\nNeve | Powered by WordPress\n\nApple Fix Pros\nCopyright © 2025 Apple Fix Pros.All rights reserved\n\n================================================================================\n\n# URL: https://www.applefixpros.com/support\n\n Skip to content \nApple Fix Pros LLC is now R2V3 Facility w/ ISO 9001, 45001, & 14001 Certifications!\n Apple Fix Pros Fresh Apples & Genuine Parts \n  * Home\n  * Mac sale\n  * Mac Parts\n  * Mac Repair\n  * Sell your Mac\n  * Support\n\n[](https://www.applefixpros.com/my-account)\nSearch for...
