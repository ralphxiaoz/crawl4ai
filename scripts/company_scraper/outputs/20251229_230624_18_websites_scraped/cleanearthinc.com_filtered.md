Chemical fixation is a soil remediation process used to treat hydrocarbon contaminated soil and/or metal contaminated soil. This process involves stabilizing contaminated material by mixing it with other earthen material, and then treating the blended material with certain chemical additives to formulate a particular material. This treatment binds the petroleum contaminants and prevents leaching. Chemcial fixation is best used for light to medium hydrocarbon contamination and/or contaminated soil impacted by metals.
  * Thermal desorption is an environmental remediation technology that is used to treat material with a broad range of hydrocarbon contamination. This process involves heating soil in a rotating dryer to remove or separate the contaminants from the soil. This process is often referred to as “low temp” thermal desorption to differentiate it from high temperature incineration. This method is primarily used to treat soil with high levels of contaminants, such as MGP soil, by heating it in a rotating dryer to destroy contaminants. Thermal treatment can be conducted at fixed facilities or at a Remediation Site with a portable unit. For large quantities, typically over 30,000 tons, onsite thermal treatment may be the most cost-effective solution. 
Several factors need to be evaluated to determine what type and size thermal treatment unit is ideal for each project including the property layout and location, available utilities, quantity of material to be treated, material characteristics and timeframe for treatment. Pricing is an important consideration in the decision-making process for an onsite thermal unit when determining if onsite thermal treatment is a viable option.
  * Bioremediation is a treatment process that provides a cost effective and environmentally conscious recycling solution for non-hazardous contaminated soils. Through a process called bioaugmentation, microorganisms are introduced into the contaminated environment as a granular product, with a proper nutrient mix to stimulate and foster their growth while breaking down the contaminants in the soil.
The process degrades organic contaminants, such as petroleum hydrocarbons, in the soil by the application of cultured microorganisms selected for their ability to metabolize the petroleum products.
Soil that is lightly contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons is inoculated with engineered bacteria and nutrients that combine to completely break down soil contaminants in 7 to 14 days. Bioremediation is typically used on soil with lower levels of contaminants. The resulting treated soil is recycled as fill material or landfill capping or cover.
  * ![Thermal treatment facility from above](https://www.cleanearthinc.com/sites/default/files/styles/feature_carousel_item_small/public/image/2021-05/SoilTreatment_ThermalUnit-Loudon-Full.jpg?h=b31c9be5&itok=It0i8_rD)
Physical treatment of soil includes special sizing and segregation processes to remove unsuitable materials from incoming soils. The resulting soils generate an engineered material suitable for beneficial reuse as fill material or landfill capping or cover.

## How Clean Earth helps 
### Safe and compliant disposal of pharmaceutical waste
Pharmaceutical waste disposal and management affects more than just the bottom line—it also has real implications for the environment, consumers and employees. With increasing oversight from regulatory agencies, every facility that disposes of pharmaceuticals, from controlled substances to OTC medication, must meet strict handling and disposal mandates. Beyond harsh financial penalties, failure to meet these requirements can result in violations that have a lasting impact on brand perception. Clean Earth's expertise assists customers – from a single retail pharmacy to a large medical complex— with the safe and compliant disposal of pharmaceutical waste.

## About our service
### DEA waste management 
Controlled substances are closely regulated by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which monitors manufacturers, distributors and providers to prevent the diversion of potentially dangerous or illegal substances. The DEA also has the authority to deliver harsh penalties to any noncompliant facility. Compliance with evolving pharmaceutical waste disposal regulations requires constant diligence throughout the entire process and meticulous documentation for accurate reporting. Clean Earth's comprehensive controlled substance management program provides robust DEA waste management solutions to help avoid and minimize these costly violations.To avoid fines and violations, waste from any location must be properly documented, segregated and destroyed, with every step from identification through disposal accurately recorded and reported to all relevant regulatory bodies. Full compliance demands that this process is regularly monitored and audited to avoid any costly oversights.
As a DEA registrant, our pharmaceutical waste disposal services are authorized to manage the destruction and disposal of controlled substances (C-II through C-V). To accomplish this, we utilize a network of Clean Earth-owned, DEA-permitted Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs). A proprietary web-based reporting tool and technicians’ electronic scales, mobile printers and laptops ensure that every step of the process is thoroughly documented and recorded in accordance with regulatory requirements. This DEA waste management approach includes regular consultations, employee compliance monitoring, delivery of appropriate waste management supplies and separation and segregation of waste for transportation. This expertly managed process helps customers avoid or minimize any regulatory penalties while protecting their brands and consumers at the same time.

Given that their waste profiles include a wide array of chemicals, solvents and other hazardous and nonhazardous waste in addition to pharmaceuticals, it is critical that pharmaceutical manufacturers engage vendors with the expertise to properly manage all waste streams. Proper characterization is vital to the successful management of any waste, but it is a particularly important aspect of managing the hazardous waste materials generated by pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. Clean Earth's waste characterization expertise helps manufacturers minimize their risk of violations and penalties by properly identifying and separating DEA hazardous and nonhazardous material, including byproducts, chemicals, solvents, R&D wastes, waste water and excess inventory. The process begins with an initial waste characterization to determine the appropriate designation for all wastes, leveraging the tools and experience gained from processing countless pharmaceutical returns and recalls. Clean Earth's proprietary database profiles more than 450,000 National Drug Code (NDC) numbers, and waste characterization includes a review of substances identified by:
EPA (40 CFR §262.11 and 261.3)
DOT (49 CFR § 173)
National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
State Regulations

To protect customers’ employees, reputations and local communities, periodic re-characterization of wastes and frequent audits of all Treatment Storage and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs) are required. Characterization results in a waste profile, which is a description of all the chemical constituents and generating process for a hazardous or nonhazardous waste. Finally, technicians print signature-ready waste manifests (tracking and shipping records) and coordinate all waste transportation logistics, allowing customers to focus on their business instead of regulatory requirements.

## Our process
### Comprehensive solutions tailored to your needs
When we process dredged material, we begin by decanting excess water off of the dredged sediments. The sediment is a location-specific mixture of sand, silt, clay, and organic matter. 
Our processing services include dewatering, stabilization, screening, and debris removal for both clean and contaminated non-hazardous dredged material. Ultimately, we blend the dredged material with our proprietary reagent admixture for stabilization and solidification to create an engineered structural fill.

In 2020, the Town of Plymouth, Massachusetts marked its 400th anniversary of the historic Mayflower landing at Plymouth Rock. As part of this anniversary, the Mayflower replica had to be brought back to its berth in Plymouth Harbor. 
#### The Project
In preparation of this event, the town sought proposals for the deepening of the Plymouth Harbor berth and mooring areas including the entrance channel. After years of sediment depositing within these waterways, sediment removal by mechanical dredging techniques was now required to provide adequate water depth in the harbor for the safe arrival of the Mayflower replica and the other vessels.
#### The solution
In total, Clean Earth processed and beneficially reused approximately 15,000 cubic yards of dredged material in preparation to celebrate this historic event. The Clean Earth team worked together to successfully complete this project on-schedule and budget.

Fuel spills 
Fuel spills are, unfortunately, a common occurrence, especially for operators of large vehicle fleets. With any spill, the first priorities are safety and containment. Ensuring a safe, compliant response begins with thorough documentation and identification of proper resources. To avoid regulatory penalties or employee injuries, fuel clean up must be conducted with a full commitment to compliance, environmental responsibility and personal safety. Clean Earth manages the entire process from identification and spill containment to clean-up. Once the fuel spill is removed, the Response Manager will take post-event photos and walk any required customer representatives through the area to confirm completion and satisfaction. The customer will also receive an Action Report with details, pictures, a call log and supporting documentation.
  * Container leaks 
The two most important steps in any container leak response are identifying the spilled material and securing the container for cleaning. For compliance and safety, the entire process must be monitored to ensure timely and accurate communication, proper documentation and appropriate procedures. After identifying the leaking material and assessing any immediate threats to human health and the environment, expert technicians will secure both the container and the surrounding area while also ensuring that no additional material is allowed to escape. The container may also be moved to a secure area, with special attention paid to weather and wind direction to maximize safety. Technicians may also perform air monitoring to check oxygen levels. Cleaning will then be performed using specialized equipment, which may include HEPA-filter vacuums, salvage drums and disposable cleaning products. Technicians will separate damaged or contaminated items from any items deemed safe. Upon completion, the Response Manager will take post-event photos and walk any required customer representatives through the area to confirm completion and satisfaction. The customer will also receive a detailed Action Report that includes images, a call log and supporting documentation.

Unknown substance handling 
Substance identification is one of the most important responsibilities entrusted to our highly trained Incident Managers, who are on call for any emergency response. In the event that a customer discovers or spills an unknown substance, Incident Managers are trained to not only identify numerous chemicals and compounds, but also to assess any potential danger. The Incident Manager will identify the unknown substance as quickly and accurately as possible, then provide the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for the substance. The SDS is then used to inform the on-site technicians of proper handling procedures, physical data, potential health hazards and equipment requirements for storage and disposal. When a customer is confronted with an unknown substance, Clean Earth's swift response, deep knowledge and specialized tools help resolve the situation safely and compliantly.
  * Chemical & laboratory spills
A chemical or laboratory spill presents many risks, from potential health and safety hazards to the possibility of damaging regulatory violations and fines. To ensure safety and compliance, highly-trained professionals must oversee the entire containment and cleaning process, focusing on consistent and accurate communication, proper documentation and clear procedures. After identifying the spilled chemical and assessing any immediate health threats, expert technicians will secure the surrounding area and contain the spill. If necessary, the container may be moved to a secure area, with special attention paid to weather conditions and wind direction to maximize safety. Technicians may also perform air monitoring to check oxygen levels. Cleaning will then be performed using specialized equipment, which may include HEPA-filter vacuums, salvage drums and disposable cleaning products. Technicians will also separate damaged or contaminated items from any items deemed safe. Upon completion, the Response Manager will take post-event photos and walk any required customer representatives through the area to confirm completion and satisfaction. The customer will also receive an Action Report with details, pictures, a call log and supporting documentation.

Natural disaster response
In addition to destruction and financial devastation, natural disasters can present communities with significant health, safety and environmental risks, often in the form of hazardous spills and leaks. To reduce the risks of injury, environmental harm or regulatory penalties, a successful disaster response requires extensive expertise and knowledge of hazardous materials and waste management, including applicable procedures and regulations. Often, natural disaster response also requires emergency spill response for fuel spills, chemical spills, DOT hazardous materials spills and EPA hazardous waste spills, as well as critical tasks such as identification of unknown substances, spill containment, proper waste handling and clean-up. The Clean Earth team has responded to thousands of environmental emergency calls, providing disaster recovery assistance after hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and other natural disasters.

## About our service
### Map & grid delineation, Your On-Site Management Tool
Once project samples have been collected, and the analytical has been reviewed, our environmental team will develop a delineated map and grid approval document for your entire project site. 
The site is broken down into grids, each of which is cross-referenced for eligibility into our multiple fixed-base facilities and/or beneficial use sites. Those results are then analyzed to consider time, cost, and location, ultimately giving our customer the best disposal location for each grid.
We recognize the importance of being environmentally responsible. Clean Earth facilities identified on the delineation map are also closest and most convenient to the project site which ultimately lowers our carbon footprint in transportation.
Consider this as your personal on-site management tool. 
![Map and Grid](https://www.cleanearthinc.com/sites/default/files/styles/small_hq/public/image/2021-06/map%20and%20grid.jpg?itok=G8Oq6QnT)
### Benefits of a map & grid
  * Provides the maximum number of outlets per grid to determine the most cost effective solutions.
  * Ability to provide and maintain a master facility approval list that allows the customer and their team to identify all the available treatment, recycling, or disposal options available to them for every grid at the project site.
  * Establishes horizontal and vertical delineation, providing cross approval into various facilities.
  * Isolates contamination that is is a key factor to saving money.
  * For all cross approvals, horizontally separated delineations can be completed and the material can be stockpiled for sampling.
  * Stockpiles are retested at the facility.
  * Minimizes the volume required for hazardous treatment in turn generating a substantial cost savings to the customer.
  * Reduces the customer’s environmental liability.
  * Identifies facilities that can accept the material and corresponding costs. This allows our customers to estimate how much time will be needed to remove the soil from the site ultimately saving time and money.

It’s also an excellent parts cleaner or degreaser. Qualified waste can be sent in shipments of as little as one drum for Allsolv 35 production.  
Clean Earth has the capability to make Allsolv 35 from Acetone, all ketones, and all acetates; from Alcohols, Toluene, Xylene, Hexane and Heptane; and from high boilers – Aromatic 100s. With distillation or any of our many other large-scale industrial and environmental services, you’ll enjoy Clean Earth's excellent customer service and nationwide reach. You’ll find we’re a responsive, helpful partner who’s just big enough to be local to you.

Safe disposal begins by targeting hazardous elements
Successful in treating a broad range of contaminated materials, we use solidification and stabilization as a treatment platform to manage, treat, and dispose of materials contaminated with substances classified as hazardous in the United States. To start the process, we mix a binding reagent into the affected material in order to solidify and/or stabilize the hazardous component. Once fully treated, the waste can be properly disposed without harm.
At Clean Earth, we count on our RCRA-permitted facilities and experienced team to bring the extensive knowledge and technical capabilities necessary to solidify and stabilize a wide variety of hazardous waste. With innovative techniques and tailor-made solutions, we are able to maximize value for our clients while reducing environmental impact for all.

Our soil treatment methods consist of mixing contaminated soils and sediments, with chemical additives to physically or chemically immobilize chemical constituents. Solidification refers to a process that forms a physical bond, encapsulating contaminates to the waste matrix.
Contaminant migration is often restricted by decreasing the surface area exposed to leaching and / or by coating the wastes with low-permeability materials. Stabilization refers to a process that reduces the risk posed by a waste by converting the contaminants into a less soluble, mobile, or toxic form. This technique involves the use of chemical additives to reduce the hazard potential.
  * ![Soil Team Member](https://www.cleanearthinc.com/sites/default/files/styles/feature_carousel_item_small/public/image/2021-06/SoilTeamMember.jpg?h=d3ae4597&itok=h_pTMK_m)
Our thermal desorption technology effectively processes and treats hazardous, non-hazardous, and high moisture contaminated soil including but not limited to hydrocarbons, MGP, pesticides, and PCBs.
Additionally, treatability studies are conducted to determine successful solutions to site-specific needs. Based on the concentrations of targeted constituents of concern, testing will be conducted on an untreated sample to document the initial concentration.
  * ![soil mobile services aerial view](https://www.cleanearthinc.com/sites/default/files/styles/feature_carousel_item_small/public/image/2022-02/Soil_MobileServices-above-view%20%282%29.jpg?h=560fc75e&itok=ASl3801P)

## Recycling & Beneficial Reuse
### Solutions for the Energy Sector
Clean Earth’s proven methodology used to recycle or beneficially reuse drill cuttings, drilling mud, and pipeline cuttings derived from gas exploration and well installations stabilizes the material both geotechnically and chemically to deliver an acceptable, beneficially reusable, construction fill to be used at Brownfields or PA Act II sites.
First, the drill cuttings are scanned for radioactivity prior to the stabilization process. Next, during the stabilization process, reagents are added to the drill or pipeline cuttings to enhance the geotechnical qualities of the material. The cuttings then go through a pugmill process utilized to mix the material which generates a reengineered material to meet site specific geotechnical specifications for recycling and beneficial reuse applications.

## About our service
### We're in the business of beneficial reuse
What makes Clean Earth unique is our true turnkey solutions for cost-effective treatment and management of waste materials and connecting them with real-world markets for recycling and beneficial reuse. By marrying the need for disposal alternatives with a parallel need for suitable construction materials and the focused drive for a sustainable future, all under complex regulatory environments, Clean Earth has effectively created a new sustainable paradigm for the industries we serve.

Reuse benefits your profits and the planet. Not only are we meeting your disposal needs with an economical solution, but we're also keeping the waste out of landfills by using a more environmentally conscious approach. 
#### We're key to a sustainable future
Using a combination of the known properties of the byproducts and wastes generated by our clients, in conjunction with market demand knowledge and research local to the sources of generation, Clean Earth identifies potential target markets for direct reuse of the materials themselves, or develops treatment processes to dispose of or transform and render the materials suitable for recycling uses.
#### We find the market to match your material
Developers and landowners that we partner with have a need for fill materials, and adding beneficial reuse materials into that mix can help them attain site permits. We diligently track market demand and conduct ongoing research on local sources of waste generation.

Types of Beneficial Reuse Material 
Clean Earth provides innovative beneficial reuse solutions for an array of specialty waste material such as dredged material, CCPs, and drill and pipeline cuttings. Clean Earth and the clients we serve seek to avoid landfills and utilize recycling and beneficial reuse applications for their waste materials.   
Through these processes and services, Clean Earth has become instrumental in the reclamation of brownfield sites and abandoned mine lands along with the closure of numerous landfills that have been redeveloped into golf courses, public parks and commercial sites. 
  * ![Processing Dredge](https://www.cleanearthinc.com/sites/default/files/styles/feature_carousel_item_small/public/image/2021-06/Processing_Dredge_0.jpeg?h=f5c32b07&itok=yBhA72Ld)
Dredged Material
Clean Earth provides innovative dredged material processing and beneficial reuse solutions for environmentally impacted dredged material generated through the process of channel maintenance and deepening projects. This dredged material, an aggregate of sediment accumulated at the bottom of a waterway, is removed to provide fifty-foot deep channels required for large ocean-going shipping vessels. Dredged material is processed through various means to meet specifications for upland beneficial reuse such as landfill capping and cover, mine reclamation, and brownfield redevelopment.
  * Clean Earth’s unique experience as a “market maker” for beneficial use of our entire spectrum of environmentally safe recycled products allows us to quickly and consistently find beneficial uses for CCPs.  
Whether it’s a one-time coal ash impoundment clean out and closure or a 20-year ash production requirements contract, Clean Earth possesses unparalleled experience in the use of pre-treatment, handling and logistics necessary to place your combustion products into sound markets and beneficial reuses. Our engineered material can be recycled or beneficially reused for road base, brownfield reclamation, and mine reclamation.  
Clean Earth's full compass of services for CCP management includes the research, technology, and strategy for go to market. For every CCP Management project we handle, we take into consideration that there is an early review needed focused from all environmental views. 
  * ![Beneficial Reuse](https://www.cleanearthinc.com/sites/default/files/styles/feature_carousel_item_small/public/image/2021-06/Beneficial%20Reuse_Dredge.jpg?h=a343d72c&itok=AgSGjGOJ)
Clean Earth developed the first PADEP permitted technology that allows oil and gas companies to recycle or beneficially reuse drill and pipeline cuttings derived from oil and gas exploration.   
The diversion of drill cutting wastes from landfill disposal results in reduced utilization of vital landfill space which allows the resulting air space to be used for other residual wastes and municipal wastes that are not amenable to beneficial reuse.  
The use of processed drill cuttings as an effective engineered cap at sites that are already environmentally impacted offsets the use of other natural resources as capping material at these contaminated sites. This minimizes the potential for the media transfer of pollutants to “clean” or un-impacted sources of soil/fill.

### HELPING CUSTOMERS ACHIEVE COMPLETE COMPLIANCE IN EVOLVING INDUSTRIES
Environmental compliance is no simple matter, regardless of how much waste a facility may generate. As requirements evolve and regulatory bodies increase their focus on enforcement, adhering to all applicable regulations can seem like a blur of identification numbers, permit applications and mandatory reports. Despite this complexity, any business that fails to manage compliance and requirements can be exposed to fines and violations that have very real implications for brand perception and financial stability. Clean Earth provides hazardous waste reporting and consulting expertise to help customers manage the complicated demands of complete compliance.

EPA ID & State ID Applications Biennial Reporting & State Reporting Hazardous Waste Audits
  * The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state regulatory agencies require that most hazardous waste-generating facilities obtain identification numbers. The requirements for these ID numbers vary depending upon whether a facility is a Large Quantity Generator (LQG), Small Quantity Generator (SQG), or a Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator (CESQG) and also upon whether or not the facility transports its own waste. In fact, application and license requirements can vary between states and also within each state, depending on which agencies implement a given hazardous waste program. Clean Earth's reporting and consulting experts manage this complexity to ensure that all EPA and state-required ID applications are completed. To remove the uncertainty from compliance, extensive regulatory knowledge is used to verify that each facility has the proper ID number and license based on location, waste type and waste quantity.
  * Once a facility has an EPA ID number and, potentially, a state ID number and/or license, they are required to track the quantity of waste generated. Among other requirements, the EPA mandates that Large Quantity Generators (LQGs) report waste types and quantities generated on a biennial basis. While SQGs and CESQGs are not typically required to complete EPA biennial reports, in some cases state regulators require that even smaller generators complete the report as well. In addition to biennial reporting requirements, most states also require similar annual, if not more frequent, reporting. In some cases, states require reporting for renewal of ID numbers or licenses. To manage the complexity of these requirements, Clean Earth's consultants help customers make sure that they are reporting the correct information to the relevant regulatory bodies. This helps limit customers’ risk of potentially damaging state and federal violations.
  * Waste categorization can be a challenging process, particularly for facilities that generate multiple waste streams. Before an organization can satisfy applicable waste regulations, they must first document all waste generated by their facilities and classify them according to type (hazardous, non-hazardous, universal, infectious, recyclable, etc.). Clean Earth customers benefit from professional waste audits designed to identify and document waste streams and applicable waste management regulations. Clean Earth fully manages this process by combining insights from years of hazardous waste experience with support from state-of-the-art tools. Pharmaceutical wastes, for example, are characterized using our proprietary database of over 450,000 National Drug Codes (NDCs). All collected data is verified against multiple sources and constantly updated to maintain compliance with evolving regulations. Clean Earth serves as a single source for the complex data management that every business needs in order to remain compliant.

Outside of our portfolio of soil treatment facilities, Clean Earth offers a number of Beneficial Use (BU) options for soil recycling. These BU sites can be brownfield sites or landfills undergoing closure and redevelopment. 
Soil is imported to these sites for use as fill and grading material, in conjunction with its state agency approved remedial action work plans or landfill closure plans. Each site offers its own unique acceptance criteria for imported fill and is overseen by a third-party engineer responsible for review of each potential source of fill. Upon review of data and an assessment that soil is suitable for a BU site, Clean Earth will match the export material with appropriate BU sites.
  * ![Audit_Clean Earth](https://www.cleanearthinc.com/sites/default/files/styles/feature_carousel_item_small/public/image/2021-06/Audit_Clean%20Earth.jpg?h=39ca385e&itok=qhd-L4Qj)
The major driver that affects whether soil is sent to the traditional soil treatment facility for recycling versus a BU site, is the chemical and physical properties of the soil to be removed. In New Jersey, BU soil will normally fall into a category of residential or non-residential fill, relative to applicable state clean-up criteria. BU soil does not require treatment and is therefore taken directly from the source to the chosen BU site. Aside from meeting the permit acceptance criteria, BU soil must also meet geotechnical specification for compaction or slope stability. BU options offer the lowest cost of disposal option because the material is directly placed into the site and does not receive additional treatment. 
Clean Earth’s Beneficial Use options offer another avenue for our clients to save money, while utilizing a secure, state-permitted and approved disposal option.

## About our service 
### Hassle-free nationwide transportation
Clean Earth’s nationwide transportation service makes removal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes a hassle-free job. Clean Earth’s company owned fleet, along with a fleet of pre-qualified independent haulers, includes a wide range of vehicles designed to seamlessly carry a broad range of materials from your site to our facilities with confidence.
In addition to full load transportation services, Clean Earth RCRA 10-day hazardous waste transfer facilities are located across the country, serving all 48 contiguous states. With multiple 10-day transfer locations, our customers can request non-hazardous and hazardous waste pickups of any size (partial or full loads) from anywhere in the United States. All locations accept both RCRA hazardous and non-hazardous wastes from various industries including energy, infrastructure, commercial, industrial, consumer commodities, medical, and pharmaceutical markets. Pickup service is available with empty drum delivery. Partial loads are consolidated into full truckloads for final shipment to one of Clean Earth’s RCRA Part B permitted hazardous waste facilities. Customers may also transport their own material to any of these 10-day transfer locations.

Pickup service is available with empty drum delivery. Partial loads are consolidated into full truckloads for final shipment to one of Clean Earth’s RCRA Part B permitted hazardous waste facilities. Customers may also transport their own material to any of these 10-day transfer locations.
Clean Earth will provide uniform manifests for your project that can be used throughout our network of facilities. Manifests are uniquely numbered and include a place for your project's specific approval number. These two numbering systems work together to provide comprehensive tracking of every pound of material moved from your site to ours.
### Adding Value & Finding Efficiencies While Managing Cost
Like many of our customers, Clean Earth is constantly looking for ways to enhance the value we provide while simultaneously managing costs. Waste transportation costs can add up quickly, particularly when waste is generated on an industrial scale. Efficiencies matter—every trip avoided, and every square foot of space saved has an impact.  
Clean Earth technicians are trained to consolidate shipments and equipment (including vacuum trucks, tankers and other specialty vehicles) to efficiently collect waste and transport it for either disposal or processing at one of our strategically located Treatment Storage and Disposal Facilities. By deploying the most efficient transportation possible, including trucks modified to improve fuel efficiency, we further reduce both the cost and the environmental impact of each load.
**About Our Team**
Our transportation team serves a wide variety of customers across the country. All Clean Earth drivers have extensive DOT training in the hazardous waste industry including but not limited to a 40-hour HAZWOPER course, in-depth security, defensive driving, labeling and load segregation, forklift, and PPE training. Clean Earth drivers routinely assist customers in labeling, loading and placarding equipment. Clean Earth routinely receives accolades from customers in all different markets based upon our driver’s, dispatch, and transportation coordinator’s performance and dedication to customer service.
