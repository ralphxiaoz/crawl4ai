### Global Supply Chains
Over the past 20 years, our executive team developed the most extensive and robust supply chain network in the industry. This network started in HK when we realized that in our industry, the way to procure parts and subcomponents was almost impossible. First, the manufacturer doesn’t want to sell any of these parts, and the market is filled with counterfeit and sub-quality goods.
We used our global engineering team to understand how the manufacturer makes the product. During this process, we developed our own rework procedure. This rework process involved many sub-parts components.
We then sourced these components from the market, and through this process developed our supply chain network
