## Minimize Your Footprint.
## Maximize Your Value.
## A Better Planet through Better ITAD
Electronic waste only takes up 2% of our landfills but accounts for 70% of our total toxic waste production.
![](https://gemlifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GemLifecycle-ICONBG.jpg)
The world of technology continues to advance, and the environmental impact of this ongoing tech advancement is growing just as rapidly.
To keep pace with technology without destroying Earth for future generations, we all need to reconsider and rewrite best practices of IT Asset Disposition and Management.
At Gem Lifecycle, we approach your retiring technology hardware with a fully integrated and holistic strategy – all the way down to the chip level.
**We have four priorities at all times:**
  1. Protect your data.
  2. Maximize the value of every device and component.
  3. Create a more sustainable planet, by not only reducing your carbon footprint, but also maintaining our Zero-Landfill Promise.
  4. Improve the lives of everyone we engage with.

## Increase Your Start To Finish ROI  
with IT Lifecycle Optimization.
At Gem Lifecycle we provide market intelligence on your electronic equipment to provide optimum value back to you. Prior to resale, we make sure that all equipment is inventoried, has its data wiped, is fully tested, and gets repackaged for sale.
We can predictively and extemporaneously analyze the entire lifecycle value of each device to determine when and how to most cost-effectively and responsibly reuse, redeploy, resell, or recycle a device and its individual components – with absolutely nothing going to the landfill.

## Corporate IT
## What We Do
Gem Lifecycle will develop a 360° customized solution for your organization. Gem Lifecycle logistics will pick-up and inventory equipment for secure delivery. Gem Lifecycle has its own fleet of trucks or can utilize 3rd party providers.
Our clients can access the pick-up request, receipt report, data destruction / erasure certificates and settlement reports through our online portal.
Equipment is received at Gem Lifecycle’s high security facility where the product is triaged and sanitized of data using NIST-800-88 / DoD 5220.22m data destruction / erasure standards.
Devices are repaired, data erased and re-sold into Gem Lifecycles extensive resale market.

## Data Centers
## What We Do
Gem Lifecycle specializes in decommissioning network hardware, servers and storage systems in your data center. We securely remove old equipment from your data center. Our clients have access to Gem Lifecycle’s Portal to track assets through our secure chain of custody.
Gem Lifecycle protects your data by overwriting data on servers, onsite or offsite. We can also shred drives onsite to a NIST-800-88 / DoD 5220.22m destruction standards.
Gem Lifecycle will provide maximum value for repurposed equipment. Equipment that can’t be resold will be recycled. 
Gem Lifecycle is a fully integrated IT asset disposition company with in-house recycling capabilities which maximizes value and reduces your carbon footprint. We harvest and repurpose parts like boards, chips, processor, cards etc. for additional value. All remaining plastics and metals are shredded, then further processed for reusable feedstock materials.
Feel free to [contact us](https://gemlifecycle.com/contact/) for more information on how we help data centers keep their electronic waste out of landfills.

## Government
## What We Do
Local and State Government are responsible for many systems to keep our communities running efficiently. But that equipment needs to be kept up to date and data secure.
Gem Lifecycle has an extended history of working with local municipalities. Gem Lifecycle operates a high security facility where all IT Assets are triaged and sanitized of data using NIST-800-88 / DoD 5220.22m data destruction / erasure standards. Devices are repaired, cleaned and re-sold into Gem Lifecycles extensive resale market.
Municipalities will have access to Gem Lifecycle’s Portal to track assets through our secure chain of custody. Through our online portal our clients can access the pick-up request, receipt report, data destruction / cleanse certificates and settlement reports.
Feel free to [contact us](https://gemlifecycle.com/contact/) for more information on how we help Government keep their electronic waste out of landfills.

## Greater Value.
## Cleaner Planet.
## Full-Service IT Asset Management
Recycling e-waste reduces the waste of valuable raw materials. Recycling electronic waste could greatly reduce the need to constantly mine new materials for the creation of the latest devices.
![](https://gemlifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GemLifecycle-ICONBG.jpg)
Gem Lifecycle takes a holistic approach to IT Asset Management and Disposition – and by starting long before devices are ready for retirement – we do more than just resell and recycle outdated IT devices.
We can predictively and extemporaneously analyze the entire lifecycle value of each device to determine when and how to most cost-effectively and responsibly reuse, redeploy, resell, or recycle a device and its individual components – with absolutely nothing going to the landfill.
And when we say, “each device,” we actually mean, “each and every device… and all its components.” From a datacenter filled with racks and drives, to a single laptop, to an individual chip, to the aluminum casing and copper wiring.
**We ensure three things.**
  1. That all data is handled and secured to the highest industry standards.
  2. That all our clients receive maximum value.
  3. That everything leaves our facilities ready to continue providing value.

## Education
## What We Do
The world is constantly changing and keeping up to date on the newest information is only a click away when students have access to computers and tablets, but keeping students equipped with the latest technology can be a challenge.
Gem Lifecycle services numerous school districts and universities. Gem Lifecycle can provide financial value for older technology.
Gem Lifecycle will arrange pick-up of equipment which is then received at Gem Lifecycle’s high security facility. Product is triaged and sanitized of data using NIST 800-88 data destruction / erasure standards. Devices are repaired, cleaned and re-sold into Gem Lifecycles extensive resale market.
Schools have access to Gem Lifecycle’s Portal to track assets through our secure chain of custody. Through our online portal, schools can access the pick-up request, receipt report, data destruction / cleanse certificates and settlement reports.
Feel free to [contact us](https://gemlifecycle.com/contact/) for more information on how we help School Districts keep their electronic waste out of landfills.

## Telecommunications
## What We Do
Telecommunications companies are responsible for storing a lot of sensitive data. Gem Lifecycle ensures all data is removed from each device and reduces the impact on our environment by repairing, re-purposing and recycling your telecom gear.
All equipment is data erased to NIST-800-88 / DoD 5220.22m standards. We evaluate equipment for resale into the proper channels to maximize returns.
End of life devices are harvested for components like boards, chips, processors, screens, digitizers etc. All remaining plastics and metals are shredded, then further processed for reusable feedstock materials.
Feel free to [contact us](https://gemlifecycle.com/contact/) for more information on how we help telecommunication companies keep their electronic waste out of landfills.

### Recycling Stats
We generate around 40 million tons of electronic waste every year, worldwide. That’s like throwing away 800 laptops every second.
Only 12.5% of E-Waste is recycled.
85% of our E-Waste are sent to landfills and incinerators are mostly burned, and release harmful toxins in the air!
Cellphones and other electronic devices contain precious metals like gold and silver. The US alone throws away cellphones with $60 million worth of gold/silver yearly.
Recycling 1 million laptops saves energy equivalent to the energy used by 3600 homes in the US annually.
Most of the components of E-Waste are electronic components that can be re-used and recycled for materials recovery.
## Re-Use

## Zero Landfills.
## Infinite Possibilities.
## Cleaning Up the Dirty Part of IT
Recycling e-waste can save enough energy to power thousands of homes per year.
![](https://gemlifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GemLifecycle-ICONBG.jpg)
Gem Lifecycles commitment to support a sustainable environment from an electronic waste perspective is a responsibility that drives the purpose for the organization.  
Gem Lifecycle’s commitment to electronic sustainability is multi faceted.
  * Reuse before Recycle: Gem Lifecycle keeps electronic waste from being disposed of into landfills as a first option, by providing programs that focus on providing fully functional assets into the secondary market for reuse.
  * Compliant Recycling: Gem Lifecycle utilizes recycling programs that are compliant with the latest environmental standards that are set forth in the electronics industry. We use only certified partners for the down streaming of their recycled materials, so that the materials being shipped are sent for re-processing back into their original raw commodity.


By partnering with Gem Lifecycle, our clients not only maximize the life-long value of the assets, but they also support making the environment a cleaner, more sustainable world.
Gem Lifecyle exists to fill the necessary role of helping clients offload IT assets in a secure and sustainable way, we exist to do that and much more.
Since our beginning in 2002 as a non-ferrous recycler, Gem Lifecyle is continually rethinking and reinventing how companies can maximize the value of IT assets while creating a cleaner and more sustainable planet for future generations.
Gem Lifecycle makes good on our commitments. Our commitments to clients, to our team members, and to the planet.
Gem Lifecycle does things the right way. We do not cut corners or take shortcuts. Gem Lifecycle safeguards our client’s data and reputation. That is how we make good on these commitments.
Gem Lifecycle’s goal is to repurpose all IT Assets that enters our facility. We test each device to determine its functionality then cleanse data, repair and re-sell / repurpose your equipment. Everything leaves our facilities is ready to continue providing value.

Gem Lifecycle will arrange pick-up of your equipment which is then received at our Gem Lifecycle high security facility. Product is triaged and sanitized of data using NIST 800-88 data destruction / erasure standards. Devices are repaired, cleaned and re-sold into Gem Lifecycles extensive resale market.
To ensure you meet your ESG goals and reduce additional carbon footprint, devices are further processed in our state-of-the-art facilities for extended value recovery and re-use. 
Devices that are beyond economical repair are dismantled and harvested for working components such as hard drives, memory, video cards, chips, processors, circuit boards, screens and batteries. Any remaining materials are then further processed to recover plastics, ferrous and non-ferrous materials for re-use. Nothing goes to the landfill. Every device that leaves our facilities are ready to continue providing value
