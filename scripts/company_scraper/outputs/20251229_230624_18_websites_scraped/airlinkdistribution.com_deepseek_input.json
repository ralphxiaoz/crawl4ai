This network started in HK when we realized that in our industry, the way to procure parts and subcomponents was almost impossible. First, the manufacturer doesn’t want to sell any of these parts, and the market is filled with counterfeit and sub-quality goods.\nWe used our global engineering team to understand how the manufacturer makes the product. During this process, we developed our own rework procedure. This rework process involved many sub-parts components.\nWe then sourced these components from the market, and through this process developed our supply chain network\n## Certifications\n[](https://airlinkdistribution.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/R2v3-Amtivo-USA-Inc.-Certificate.pdf)\n[](https://airlinkdistribution.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ISO-14001-Amtivo-USA-Inc.-Certificate.pdf)\n[](https://airlinkdistribution.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ISO-9001-Amtivo-USA-Inc.-Certificate-1.pdf)\n[](https://airlinkdistribution.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ISO-45001-Amtivo-USA-Inc.-Certificate.pdf)\nSign Up for our Latest Deals\n\n================================================================================\n\n# URL: https://airlinkdistribution.com/about\n\n+1 714.338.0975 sales@airlinkdistribution.com\n# About\nHeadquartered in Orange County, CA, **Airlink** is a full solution provider for all your mobility and consumer electronics products needs.\nAs an industry leader in after-sales services and product distribution of telecommunication and consumer electronics products, we offer safe, secure and reliable “re-purposing solutions” on a global scale.\nWorking on behalf of leading manufacturers, wireless carriers, telecommunication providers and retailers, Airlink is able to utilize our global network to effectively assume operational responsibility for the complete supply chain, including reverse logistics.\nAirlink will not only be your re-purpose partner, but also your environmentally responsible partner.
