##### What is Big Data Supply Inc?

##### How relevant is R2v3 & RIOS certification?
Being R2v3 & RIOS certified means Big Data Supply inc. has followed the best practices in the IT and electronics industry, especially regarding the treatment of electronic waste and secure data management/deletion.
RIOS certification is an ANSI-accredited standard, certifying that a company is compliant with ISO:14001 (environment), ISO:9001 (quality), and OHSAS:18001 (safety). 
R2v3 & RIOS certification is rewarded _only_ to companies that have achieved high-level responsible recycling standards.
Having your IT assets purchased and disposed of by R2v3 & RIOS-certified companies like Big Data Supply Inc. assures you a secure and consistent level of service anywhere and anytime. 
##### Are your ITAD services available worldwide?
Thanks to our holistic solutions, professional but friendly service, and cost-effective services, today, Big Data Supply Inc. has become a major industry player worldwide.
Today Big Data Supply Inc. has locations in Southern California, Singapore, and the Netherlands, offering our comprehensive ITAD services.
##### Do you work with individuals?
While our primary focus is on businesses, we will work with individuals when they are selling goods in bulk. We prefer that each and every business is worth your time and ours.
##### Is my old IT equipment worth anything?
Don't underestimate the value of your used and seemingly obsolete IT assets. Many of our clients have been surprised at the value they got out of their used equipment, so don't be discouraged from selling your IT assets, even if they may seem too obsolete at the moment.
How much value can you get from your old IT equipment?
The answer will depend on several different factors, including but not limited to:
  * **Age:** the older an IT asset is, the lower its market price will be
  * **Condition:** an IT equipment in good condition will be priced higher compared to those with functional or cosmetic defects
  * **Availability of newer models:** most electronics equipment will decrease in price when a direct replacement has been released. If there isn't any direct replacement for the equipment (even if it's fairly old), the price should remain stable.
  * **Rarity:** very rare IT equipment can go up in price due to scarcity.


Fortunately, checking for the average market price of your IT equipment should be fairly easy. You can simply search for similar goods on market price sites like eBay, Amazon, or even Craigslist and check how much others sell this product for.
##### How will you handle the disposal of sensitive information?
We understood the importance of securely eradicating your sensitive or confidential data. Depending on the device and your requests, we can either securely wipe the storage medium (i.e., hard drive)through state-of-the-art data destruction methods or physically destroy the storage medium via shredding or other methods.
We can perform the data eradication or physical destruction at our facility or yours (on-premises) depending on your preferences. Being R2v3 & RIOS certified, we will ensure to eliminate the risk of any of your sensitive information being compromised.
##### Can I get a certificate of destruction?
Yes, Big Data Supply Inc. can provide certificates of destruction after we've performed secure data deletion on your device or storage equipment. We can also provide a chain of custody documents when required.
##### Will disposal or recycling cost me?
In most cases, any associated disposal or recycling fees are negated from the resale value of your IT assets. Recycling fees are evaluated by the weight of the scrap commodity contained in the IT asset, which can vary depending on volume and value.

##### How Do You Perform a Data Center Decommissioning?
“Decommissioning” refers to removing something from service, and in this case of data center decommissioning, refers to the removal of IT assets and equipment from a data center.  
  
IT equipment may be removed from a data center with data center decommissioning services for numerous reasons, but typically it involves two main reasons:  
  
1. Upgrade of existing equipment  
In this case, old IT equipment (i.e. servers) is removed to be replaced by newer ones. This is a frequent activity in many organizations but still requires careful planning and execution from a reliable data center decommissioning company.  
  
2. Data center shutdown  
Another common case when data center decommissioning service is required is when a data center is going to be shut down.   
  
Shutting down a data center can be quite a complex process involving many different systems and IT equipment. Depending on your location, there may also be local, state, and federal regulations that must be followed, and in many cases, will require the assistance of certified data center decommissioning companies.  
  

##### How Do You Do Data Center Decommissioning?
A crucial consideration when planning a data center decommissioning is that carelessly decommissioning your IT equipment may compromise the data stored within the IT equipment, which is especially true if you are decommissioning storage devices.   
  
Depending on your location, there may also be potential legal ramifications if you perform negligent data center decommissioning.  
  
There are five key considerations data center decommissioning services:   
  
1. Perform critical backups of your data: this is especially important if you plan to virtually or physically destroy the IT asset. It’s crucial to properly back up and store your data to prevent the loss of critical information. For legal purposes, a backup may also serve as proof of what data was on the machine that was disposed of.  
  
2. Keep an audit trail: it’s crucial to establish a record that centralizes the information on decommissioning data center IT assets that contain the list of all decommissioned equipment, the process performed during the data center decommissioning services, the decommissioned date, and so on.  
  
3. Authentication management: managing users and controlling their access to the data center’s network. This phase is especially about removing old user IDs from your system so they can no longer access your network.  
  
4. Compliance management: depending on your industry, you may be required to abide by a certain set of industry regulations when decommissioning data center IT assets, such as NIST, PCI DSS, HIPAA, FERPA, and FISMA. In most cases, these regulations will require you to accurately record every IT asset from purchase to data eradication to disposal/destruction.  
  

##### What Is a Data Center Decommissioning Plan?
The reality of managing a data center is that you’ll always need to deal with limited operating space, and so data center decommissioning service will always be an important part of data center management.   
  
A data center owner with a strong data center decommissioning program can maximize the return value of the IT assets used in the data center by:  
  
1. Ensuring the right course of action is taken with each decommissioned IT asset (disposal, recycling, re-utilization, sale, etc.)  
2. Ensuring all retired/replaced equipment is properly removed to give space to new assets  
3. Ensure secure, responsible, and environmentally-friendly disposition of each IT asset  
  
Before data center decommissioning is executed, a data center decommissioning plan should be developed. Such plans are usually developed by data center decommissioning companies and include the removal, sale, and disposal of all equipment in the data center.  
  
Data center decommissioning without a comprehensive plan is close to impossible, and a comprehensive plan that is tailored to the needs of the data center will ensure a smooth transition and execution of the project.   
  
The basic idea of the data center decommissioning plan is to determine the resale value of each retired IT asset in the data center: assets with high resale value can be sold, while assets with low resale value and expendables such as ductwork and cables are often recycled by a data center decommissioning company. When possible (i.e. when the IT equipment is still relatively new and/or in a good condition), then the asset may be repurposed.  
  

##### What Are the Phases of Data Center Decommissioning?
While the actual process may vary depending on various factors, and each entity may establish its own process, here are the typical phases of a data center decommissioning service:  
  
  
**For upgrading old IT equipment  
**  
1. Establishing migration plan: data from old IT equipment must be migrated to the replacement equipment. All stakeholders must be notified.  
2. Perform migration: all activities are performed in accordance with the migration plan established in the previous phase. Certificates of migration are often published for compliance purposes.   
3. Establish a data center decommissioning plan: ensuring decommissioning of the older IT equipment is executed while preserving critical data. For IT assets that can’t be reused, a plan for hardware reclamation or disposal is created.   
4. Data center decommissioning: execution of the decommission plan after it has been approved, decommission steps are completed in accordance with the approved plan by a data center decommissioning company.  
5. Evaluation and post-decommission review: reviews timelines for completion for each step.   
  
  
**For shutting down a data center  
**  
Shutting down a data center may require you to follow state, federal, and local regulations which may differ for different pieces of IT equipment. Here are the phases you may need to follow to ensure compliance:  
  
1. Create equipment list: list different types of equipment separately to make evaluations easier  
2. Establish and migrate: develop a data center migration plan. Migrate important data to target systems (i.e. backup storage tape)  
3. Power generator removal: establish a removal plan for power generators and related equipment, including emergency generators.  
4. HVAC system removal: establish a removal plan for HVAC systems including cooling units, external chillers, and their associated systems. Refer back to the equipment list.   
5. Server removal: create a removal plan for servers   
6. Data center decommissioning: complete tasks from the data center decommissioning plan according to the timeline  
7. Evaluation and review: includes information on tasks completed for each IT asset.  
  

##### How Long do Data Centers Last?
A data center building could last around 15 to 20 years, much shorter than typical buildings with a 75 to 100-year life span.  
  
The paneling and steel frame could last longer, up to 60 years, but the IT assets within the data center may need to be updated every three to four years. While the building itself could last quite long, when the mechanical and electrical hardware is already out of date, the only sensible thing is to contact a data center decommissioning company.

###### Frequently Asked Questions
##### What is Big Data Supply Inc?
Big Data Supply Inc. is your one-stop, premier R2v3 & RIOS-certified IT asset disposition (ITAD) company.
We buy IT equipment and electronic devices in bulk from companies of all sizes, and we may recycle or resell these IT assets. 
At the moment, Big Data Supply Inc. sells virtually all data storage equipment, especially tape storage media. We offer comprehensive disposition and recycling services, including but not limited to:
  * Permanent and secure asset data eradication
  * Comprehensive IT removal
  * Hardware recycling
  * Eco-responsible and secure disposal of obsolete items
  * [Third-party OEM maintenance](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/oem-maintenance/)


##### How relevant is R2v3 & RIOS certification when shredding my tapes?
Being R2v3 & RIOS certified means Big Data Supply inc. has followed the best practices in the IT and electronics industry, especially regarding the treatment of electronic waste (which is relevant in shredding practices) and secure data management/deletion.
RIOS certification is an ANSI-accredited standard, certifying that a company is compliant with ISO:14001 (environment), ISO:9001 (quality), and OHSAS:18001 (safety). 
R2v3 & RIOS certification is rewarded _only_ to companies that have achieved high-level responsible recycling standards.
Having your IT assets, including data tapes, disposed of by R2v3 & RIOS-certified companies like Big Data Supply Inc. assures you a secure and consistent level of service anywhere and anytime. 
##### Will shredding or recycling cost me?
In most cases, any associated disposal or recycling fees (including shredding) are negated from the resale value of your IT assets. Recycling fees are evaluated by the weight of the scrap commodity contained in the IT asset, which can vary depending on volume and value.
##### Can I securely wipe my data without shredding?
Yes. 
Many companies opt to shred their used data tapes or perform other methods of physical destruction so they can be 100% sure about the security and integrity of their confidential data. 
Doing so effectively eliminates your ability to reuse or sell the storage tape, lowering the ROI of your investment.
However, there are actually reliable methods to ensure the secure deletion of your data _without_ physical destruction.
Here at Big Data Supply Inc., we understand the importance of securely eradicating your sensitive or confidential data. Depending on the device and your requests, we can either securely wipe the storage medium (i.e., storage tape)through state-of-the-art data destruction methods or physically destroy the storage medium via shredding or other methods.
We can perform secure data eradication or shredding at our facility or yours (on-premises) depending on your preferences. Being R2v3 & RIOS certified, we will ensure to eliminate the risk of any of your sensitive information being compromised.
##### Is my old storage data tape worth anything?
Should you shred your storage tape instead of selling it?
Don't underestimate the value of your used and seemingly obsolete IT assets, including your data tapes. Many of our clients have been surprised at the value they got out of their used equipment, so don't be discouraged from selling your IT assets, even if they may seem too old or even too broken at the moment.
How much value can you get from your old IT equipment?
The answer will depend on several different factors, including but not limited to:
  * **Age:** the older an IT asset is, the lower its market price will be
  * **Condition:** an IT equipment in good condition will be priced higher compared to those with functional or cosmetic defects
  * **Availability of newer models:** most electronics equipment will decrease in price when a direct replacement has been released. If there isn't any direct replacement for the equipment (even if it's fairly old), the price should remain stable.
  * **Rarity:** very rare IT equipment can go up in price due to scarcity.


Fortunately, checking for the average market price of your used storage tape or tape drive should be fairly easy. You can simply search for similar goods on market price sites like eBay, Amazon, or even Craigslist and check how much others sell this product for.

## CHOOSING YOUR IT ASSET DISPOSITION COMPANY: 5 KEY CONSIDERATIONS
In disposing of your retired IT assets, it’s crucial to choose the right ITAD company with a well-defined and well-structured program to ensure the security and integrity of your data, maximize ROI of each asset, control your assets, and stay in compliance with regulatory requirements.  

With that being said, here are five key considerations you should have when choosing an IT asset disposition company:
  
1. “IT assets” refer to any computing device that is used for both personal or work purposes.  
  
2. Data center IT asset disposition services specifically focus on secure, responsible, and eco-friendly disposition of IT equipment used by organizations in their data centers.  
  
3. IT asset disposition companies may also offer IT assets lifecycle management services. Lifecycle management should begin before a new IT asset is purchased. ITAD companies should help create protocols for safe disposal, following a device through its entire lifecycle.   
  
4. For any IT assets, it’s crucial for the company to fully consider various options whether the IT assets can be repaired, reused, or recycled before the IT asset is disposed of. Disposal should be the last possible option.   
  
5. Since ITAD companies directly deal with the data security of the disposed of assets, it’s crucial for organizations looking to partner with ITAD companies to perform higher levels of due diligence. It’s crucial only to partner with IT asset disposition companies that have maintained data security best practices.   

In short, it’s crucial for organizations to find an appropriate ITAD company capable of supporting your organization’s long-term objectives.

###### Frequently Asked Questions
##### What is IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) service?
IT Asset Disposition or ITAD service is the process of disposing of used, retired, or unwanted IT assets (i.e., equipment) in a secure, environmentally sustainable, and cost-effective manner. 
In practice, the ITAD process involves disposing of end-of-life IT equipment such as servers, computers, storage devices (HDDs, SSDs, backup tapes,) networking devices, and others with three key focuses:
  * Ensuring the data stored within the IT assets is securely wiped to prevent data leak/breach
  * Minimizing possibilities of environmental damage
  * Maximizing the value of the retired IT asset (i.e., via sale, repurposing, or recycling)


##### Why is IT asset disposition service necessary?
Proper IT asset disposition service is necessary for three main reasons:
  * **Security:** preventing confidential and sensitive data (especially consumers’ data) from falling into the wrong hands


  * **Sustainability:** reducing the negative environmental footprints of e-waste, for example by minimizing waste in landfill or bodies of water. Promoting repurposing and recycling of retired IT assets.
  * **Compliance:** ensuring the organizations disposing of their IT assets stay compliant with various regulations governing environmental sustainability and data privacy.


##### What type of equipment do ITAD services typically include?
ITAD services cover _all_ types of IT assets and equipment, but some of the most common ones are:
  * Computers (desktop computers, laptops, servers, and mobile devices)
  * Storage devices (hard drives, SSDs, data tapes)
  * Networking equipment (network switches, routers, etc.)
  * Printers, and other computer peripherals
  * Various electronic components (adapters, power supplies, circuit boards, etc.)


##### How is data security maintained during the ITAD process?
Since one of the core objectives of ITAD services is to prevent confidential, data from being exposed, the ITAD vendor may use a range of measures to maintain data security, including but not limited to:
  * **Secure data wiping:** data is securely erased from the IT asset using specialized software to ensure it’s unrecoverable


  * **Physical destruction:** physical destruction of IT assets to make sure sensitive data is unrecoverable


  * **Chain of custody:** retired IT assets are tracked and monitored throughout the whole disposition process to prevent theft or loss


  * **Secure transportation:** retired IT assets are transported using secure protocols and vehicles to prevent theft


  * **Background checks:** all employees of the ITAD vendor must undergo rigorous background checks (i.e., make sure they have no criminal history) to ensure safety and security throughout the whole process. 


##### What is the difference between ITAD and e-waste recycling?
E-waste recycling solely focuses on recovering valuable materials from electronic waste, including retired IT assets, while ITAD also focuses on environmental sustainability and data security.
The main activity of e-waste recycling is the dismantling of IT assets to recover valuable materials such as aluminum, gold, silicon, and copper. On the other hand, ITAD services also involve secure data wiping, asset tracking, and responsible disposal/recycling. 
##### What are IT asset disposition certificates?
IT asset disposition certificates are official documents issued by ITAD companies that provide legitimate proof that the retired IT assets have been disposed of in a secure, environmentally responsible way and in compliance with relevant regulations and laws. 
The certificate can be used to demonstrate the organization’s compliance with relevant data privacy and environmental laws/regulations, as well as other relevant standards.
##### Does it matter if an ITAD company has certifications?
Certifications and relevant accreditations indicate that an ITAD company has demonstrated credibility and compliance with relevant standards, regulations, and best practices. 
Important certifications in the ITAD industry include:
  * ISO 14001 for environmental management. 
  * ISO 9001 for quality management
  * R2v3 & RIOS (Responsible Recycling). An ITAD company that possessed R2v3 & RIOS certification has demonstrated that it follows responsible recycling practices, including environmental protection, worker health and safety, and data security
  * E-stewards. Given to companies that have maintained responsible recycling practices, quite similar to R2v3 & RIOS.


It’s always a good idea to carefully evaluate potential IT asset disposition companies based on their certifications, accreditations, experience, and reputation before committing to one vendor.
##### Can we be compliant with data handling while using an ITAD company?
Yes, and in fact, working with the right ITAD company can help us stay compliant with relevant data handling laws and regulations.
Certified ITAD companies like Big Data Supply Inc. used specialized data wiping and physical destruction methods to ensure data is unrecoverable from IT assets before recycling, reuse, or disposal. 
##### Does it cost anything to use an ITAD company?
Some ITAD companies may charge a fee for pickup and disposal of IT assets, while some may charge a fee for their services.
Additionally, some IT asset disposition companies may offer secure data wiping and destruction services for a fee.
You can sell your retired IT assets in bulk for free without any charge to Big Data Supply Inc.
##### Which is more beneficial: using ITAD services or selling IT hardware ourselves?  

The answer to this question would depend on the organization’s specific goals and needs, as well as the available resources.
Here are some factors to consider:
  * **Data security: selling your retired assets to an ITAD company can ensure data is securely wiped, and they’ll be able to provide a certificate of data destruction for compliance purposes.If your organization does not have the necessary expertise or resources to perform secure data wiping, it may be beneficial to use ITAD services.**
  * **Expertise:** ITAD companies have expertise in handling, recycling and disposing of IT assets in an environmentally sustainable manner. 
  * **ROI: Selling your IT assets yourselves may result in a higher ROI, but finding the buyer can prove to be a challenge. Selling your IT assets to an ITAD company may be cost-effective if you are selling in bulk and/or if your IT equipment is in poor condition or is already too old.**
  * **Time and resources: using ITAD services may save your organization’s valuable time and resources, as you won’t need to handle the complex processes of disposing of the retired IT assets yourself (data wiping, packaging, transport, disposal, etc.)**
  * **Compliance: certified ITAD companies can ensure that your organization remains compliant with relevant environmental and data privacy regulations when disposing of IT assets.**

## 4 key considerations  

## YOU SHOULD MAKE WHEN VETTING IT ASSET RECOVERY COMPANIES
We understand your concern that all of the IT asset recovery services out there are going to make claims about their capabilities, and choosing the right partner for your needs can be quite difficult.
##### With that being said, here are four key considerations you should make when vetting IT asset recovery companies:
**1. PAST CLIENTS AND PROJECTS**  
If you are dealing with an experienced IT asset recovery company, they would be happy to share testimonials and case studies of past clients. If possible, ask whether they can refer you to a past client who can corroborate their claims.
You might also want to assess whether they’ve worked with other companies similar to yours, especially if the industry you’re in involves specific compliance requirements and restrictions.
**2. IT ASSET DISPOSITION AND RECOVERY CERTIFICATIONS**  
One of the best ways to assess an ITAD vendor’s credibility is to ask them for their certification audit reports. Big Data Supply Inc. is both R2v3 & RIOS certified, two important certifications in the IT asset recovery field.
R2v3 & RIOS certification is only awarded to companies that have proven to be compliant with the highest responsible recycling standards. RIOS certification, on the other hand, is an ANSI-accredited standard that meets all processes from ISO:14001 (environment), ISO:9001 (quality), and OHSAS:18001 (safety).
**3. FAIR VALUATION OF RETIRED IT EQUIPMENT**  
Make sure to choose an IT asset recovery company that offers fast, reliable, and fair IT asset recovery services so you can maximize the resale value and ROI of each retired IT asset. Some ITAD vendors may only purchase equipment from a limited number of manufacturers, which can be an issue if you are planning a large-scale IT asset recovery. Big Data Supply Inc. will purchase IT equipment from all manufacturing brands with different types and models. PICK-UP SERVICE  
  
Will you need to deliver your retired equipment? If you’d like more versatility, consider an IT asset recovery company that offers pick-up service, as well as the options to perform data eradication on-site or off-site according to your preferences.
**4. DATA SAFETY**  
Big Data Supply Inc. is ISO 9001, ISO 27001, and OHSAS certified. We also work in compliance with the new GDPR regulations, so you are assured that your data will be wiped professionally according to ISO standards.  
  
You’ll get a certificate of data destruction for each storage device processed to ensure your organization stays compliant with legislative regulations and corporate risk management requirements.
###### Frequently Asked Questions
##### What is an IT asset recovery service?  

IT asset recovery service is a comprehensive program that enables organizations to handle and manage the disposal of their end-of-life or surplus IT equipment. The IT asset recovery services include secure data destruction, environmentally responsible recycling, and valuable component resale. The central goal of the IT asset recovery services is to get the maximum value from each IT asset in a secure, compliant, and environmentally-sound manner. Detailed IT inventory assessment, residual value determination, and customized recovery strategies are involved in IT asset recovery services. Recovered assets are, therefore, both financially optimized and also pay significant dividends in the form of corporate responsibility and data security.
##### How can IT asset recovery services be beneficial?  

IT asset recovery services provide a range of advantages:
**Financial:** IT asset recovery services can turn unused or outdated IT equipment into a source of revenue or trade-in value, helping to offset costs of new technology investments. 
**Environmental:** IT asset recovery solutions promote sustainable practices by ensuring that e-waste is disposed of or recycled in an eco-friendly manner, reducing the environmental impact. 
**Data security:** IT asset recovery services include rigorous processes to erase or destroy data stored on devices, thereby protecting against data breaches. 
**Space management:** by removing obsolete equipment, organizations can optimize their physical space, leading to a more efficient and organized work environment. 
**Compliance:** Compliance with legal and regulatory standards is another key benefit, as IT asset recovery services ensure adherence to data protection laws and environmental regulations.
##### What types of IT assets can be recovered?  

A wide array of IT assets can be included in IT asset recovery services from Big Data Supply. This involves: 
**Computing hardware:** Computing equipment like desktops, laptops, and servers, which are common in most business operations. 
**Networking equipment** : Networking equipment like routers, switches, and wireless devices, is also recoverable, as these are integral to maintaining an organization's network infrastructure. 
**Storage devices:** Storage devices such as data tape media, hard drives, solid-state drives, and backup systems, are crucial for data recovery and reuse. 
**Peripheral devices:** Printers, scanners, and monitors can be repurposed or recycled. 
Additionally, **specialized equipment** such as data center components and telecommunications systems are often part of IT asset recovery, reflecting their value and potential for repurposing.
##### What steps should I take before sending my IT assets for recovery?  

Before sending IT assets for recovery, a detailed preparation process is necessary.
**First** , create a list of all the assets, noting down model numbers, serial numbers, and current condition. This list aids in tracking and accountability. 
**Second,** ensure that all data is securely backed up, as it will likely be erased during the recovery process. Any sensitive or confidential information should be handled according to your company’s data security protocols. 
**Third,** deauthorize and uninstall any software to avoid licensing issues. 
**Fourth,** physically clean the equipment to ensure it’s in the best possible condition, and consider factory resetting devices. 
**Last,** ask your IT asset recovery company about any specific packing instructions or guidelines they may have to ensure safe and secure transportation of your assets.
##### What is the turnaround time for IT asset recovery?  

The turnaround time for IT asset recovery services can widely vary. Factors influencing the timeline include the volume and type of assets, specific recovery services needed (like data destruction or refurbishing), and the processing capacity of the service provider. Generally, a comprehensive assessment of your assets will be conducted by the IT asset recovery company to offer a more tailored timeframe. It's also influenced by logistical considerations such as transportation and sorting of assets. Communicating your expectations and requirements with the IT asset recovery company early in the process can help in getting a more accurate estimate of the turnaround time.
##### Do you offer data destruction services as part of your IT asset recovery process?
Data destruction is an essential part of IT asset recovery services. This step involves wiping sensitive data from storage devices completely to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches. There are different techniques to do this including software-based wiping or physical destruction of storage media. These different techniques have to conform to the standards for data destruction set by various industries and compliance with how data is managed legally or per industry regulations. Big Data Supply offers secure data destruction and will provide you with a data destruction certificate if needed.

###### Frequently Asked Questions
##### What is third-party maintenance for IT equipment?  

Third-party maintenance for IT equipment is like having a skilled mechanic for your car, but instead, for your company's tech gear. When your business has a bunch of servers, servers, storage systems, and networking devices, all these types of IT equipment need regular check-ups, repairs, and sometimes parts replaced. Now, usually, the company that sold you these gadgets (like Dell, HP, or Cisco) offers to take care of them – this is called original equipment manufacturer (OEM) maintenance. But, there's another option – third-party maintenance.
TPM is when a separate company that offers OEM end of warranty support service steps in to keep your IT stuff in top shape. Third-party maintenance companies like Big Data Supply specialize in maintenance and often offer more flexible, cost-effective solutions. We have expert teams who know their way around a wide range of IT equipment, not just one brand. So, you get a high level of service but at a lower cost and with a more personal touch. It's like choosing a trusted local garage over a big-brand car dealership for your car's servicing.
##### What types of equipment are covered under third-party maintenance services?  

At Big Data Supply, our third-party maintenance services are pretty extensive and cover just about every piece of key equipment you can think of in your IT setup. It's like having a one-stop-shop for all your tech-care needs. Here’s a list of what we cover:
**Servers** : These are the powerhouses of your IT infrastructure. Whether they're for hosting websites, managing emails, or running applications, we've got the expertise to maintain and repair servers of various brands like IBM, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Cisco, Sun/Oracle and SuperMicro and models like Dell PowerEdge, HPE ProLiant B DL-Series, IBM pSeries RS/6000, etc.
**Networking Equipment:** This includes the essential gear that keeps your network humming, like routers, switches, and wireless access points. We understand how crucial networking is for business operations, so we make sure yours is always in top shape. We cover networking equipment of brands like Dell, Juniper, Cisco, HPE, Brocade, etc.
**Storage Equipment:** From high-capacity hard drives to complex SAN and NAS systems, we cover it all. Keeping your data safe and accessible is our priority. We cover storage equipment of brands like Netapp, Dell, HPE, IBM, EMC, Hitachi, etc.
**Data Centers:** The heart of your IT operations, data centers come with their unique maintenance needs. We provide comprehensive care for your data center's infrastructure, ensuring it runs efficiently and reliably.
**Hard Drives and More:** Even the smaller components of your IT setup, like individual hard drives, are within our scope of service.
In short, if it's a critical part of your IT system, we can maintain and support it. At Big Data Supply, we're committed to providing you with a wide-ranging, flexible, and effective third-party maintenance service that keeps your entire IT infrastructure in peak condition.
##### What are the different levels of support available in third-party maintenance packages?  

When you sign up for third-party maintenance for your IT equipment, it's like picking a care package that best fits your tech's needs. As a third-party maintenance provider, Big Data Supply offers various levels of support, so you can choose what works best for your business:
**Low Support:** Think of this as the 'essential' package. It usually includes things like parts replacement, remote monitoring, and post-incident follow-up. It’s perfect for businesses that just need a helping hand now and then.
**Medium Support:** This is a step up. Besides the offers from the previous tier, it also includes 24/7 telephone technical support. If your business depends heavily on its tech running smoothly all the time, this level could be a good fit.
**Most Support:** Premium support might offer all the bells and whistles. This tier also includes on-site technical support with 4-hr response.
**Customized Support:** We can meet your specific goals by crafting a custom third-party hardware maintenance service.
##### Can a custom maintenance support solution be created for specific organizational needs?  

Absolutely! Custom OEM end of warranty support solutions can be created at Big Data Supply. We understand that one size doesn't fit all when it comes to tech support. That's why we offer the flexibility to craft a maintenance plan that fits your organization’s needs and goals.
You can fill up a contact form and write there about your company's specific needs. Maybe you've got some older equipment that needs extra care, or perhaps you're running a mix of brands and need a plan that covers them all. Or you might need super-fast response times for critical systems. Our third-party hardware maintenance service team will listen to your needs and then put together a package that targets those areas.
It's all about getting the support that matches your business's requirements – whether it's round-the-clock monitoring, special parts replacement services, or even specialized technical support. So yes, creating a custom solution is not just possible, but it's often a highlight of what makes our third-party maintenance such a great choice for many businesses.
##### Is there worldwide support available for third-party maintenance services?  

Yes! At Big Data Supply, we're proud to offer third-party hardware maintenance services on a global scale. It's like having a reliable IT support team, no matter where you are in the world. Whether your business operates in one country or spans multiple continents, we've got your back.
Our worldwide OEM end of warranty support means that if you face any issues with your IT equipment, you won't be left in the lurch, regardless of your location. We understand that in the fast-paced world of business, having immediate and effective support is crucial. That's why we've established a network of skilled technicians and resources, ensuring that help is always close at hand.
So, whether your servers need attention in Sydney, your storage systems require servicing in San Francisco, or your network devices need diagnostics in Toronto, we're ready to assist with our third-party hardware maintenance services. Our goal is to provide consistent, quality support to keep your IT infrastructure running smoothly, wherever you are.
##### How much can I save with 3rd party maintenance?
Switching to third-party maintenance can be a real money-saver for your business. Think of it like opting for an affordable yet quality local mechanic instead of always going to the car dealership for repairs. On average, businesses can save anywhere from 40% to 70% on their IT maintenance costs with third-party maintenance, compared to original equipment manufacturer maintenance.
**_Here's why it's cheaper:_**
**Competitive Pricing:** Third-party maintenance often has lower overheads and more flexible pricing models.
**Customized Plans:** With third-party maintenance you can choose only the services you need, avoiding the cost of unnecessary extras.
**Extended Equipment Life:** Third-party maintenance services from big Data Supply can help you keep your existing equipment running longer, delaying costly upgrades.
**Multivendor Support:** Instead of dealing with different OEMs for each type of equipment, you get a one-stop solution, which often works out cheaper.
The exact savings will depend on your specific IT environment and the type of equipment you have. But, for many businesses, the cost difference is significant enough to make switching to third-party maintenance a smart financial decision.

## meet our founder. 
Say hello to the brains of Big Data. Brian has been shaking this industry up since the early 2000s. That's about 20 years if you're not familiar with the modern calendar. Early in his career, while working in sales and marketing, one of Brian's clients began recycling data tape media. Seeing that nobody had an online presence for this service at this time, Brian laced up his jumping shoes and pounced. Just starting off in his technology experience, Brian was turning millions in revenue and soon founded a company called Recycle Your Media in 2005. But Brian always had a vision for more, a full-service end-of-life data solution.  

  
After selling Recycle Your Media in 2012, Big Data Supply Inc. was born. A company that not only recycles data tape but the entire data center and more. Data Tape Media, Data Storage Hardware, Servers/Disk Array, Network Hardware to Telecom, Computers and Mobile Devices. A full-service end-of-life data solutions company with an unbending vision to the be the biggest and best in the industry. Mission currently being accomplished.

###### Frequently Asked Questions
##### How can I sell my old IT equipment?
Whether it's a server or it's an industrial-grade backup tape, there are always viable ways to sell your old IT equipment and make some money from it.   
  
While your options may vary depending on the type of equipment, your location, or other factors, basically, you have three major options in selling your old IT equipment:  
  
1. Finding your own buyers on peer-to-peer marketplaces (like eBay), you have the most freedom in setting your prices and "promoting" your IT equipment, but it can be difficult to find the right buyer willing to purchase the goods at your terms.   
  
2. Listing your IT equipment on classified sites like Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or even Amazon. It's typically easier to find buyers on these platforms when compared to on peer-to-peer marketplaces, but you'll have less freedom.  
  
3. Selling your IT equipment to trusted IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) companies that will take the goods off your hands. The easiest and quickest option (and you can still sell your IT equipment at a fair market price). If your IT equipment contains sensitive/regulated data, these ITAD companies will also perform secure data eradication for you.  
  
  

##### What is the best place to sell used IT equipment?
Out of the three options we've discussed above, the best option for selling your IT equipment can vary depending on several key factors:  
  
• Condition/age of the equipment: if the IT equipment is fairly old and/or is no longer in good condition, then finding your own buyer via listing sites or peer-to-peer marketplaces can be difficult, and it's unlikely you'll get a fair price on these platforms. Selling to an IT Asset Disposition company may be the most viable option in such cases.   
  
• Demand: some types of IT equipment may be more in-demand than others. Also, customers may prefer certain brands or models over others. If your IT equipment is in-demand, then it's probably better to list the IT asset on peer-to-peer or classified marketplaces so you can maximize its value. However, if the IT equipment is not very in-demand, selling used IT equipment to an ITAD company can save you some time.   
  
• Sensitive data: if the IT equipment stores data (i.e., hard drives, SSDs, smartphones/tablets, etc.), and you are not 100% confident about wiping the data on your own, then it's best to just sell the IT equipment to IT Asset Disposition companies like Big Data Supply Inc. to ensure data security and compliance with relevant regulations.  
  
  

##### Is old IT equipment worth anything?
The answer will depend on the type of IT equipment you are trying to get, as well as where you are buying the used IT equipment from.  
  
The biggest pros of buying used IT equipment is obviously price. Used IT equipment will obviously be priced lower than brand new ones, and you might be lucky in getting a fairly new piece of IT asset in a fairly good condition. Buying used IT assets can let you increase the number of IT assets quickly while staying on a budget.  
  
The main downside of buying used IT equipment is the fact that you won't get any factory warranty you'd otherwise get from buying brand new IT assets. However, if you are buying from reputable IT Asset Disposition companies like Big Data Supply Inc., you can ask for an inspection sheet for the IT equipment you are going to purchase so you can evaluate its current condition.  
  
If you are buying from reputable sellers (or a friend you can trust), then buying used IT equipment can definitely be worth it so you can maximize their ROI.  
  
  

##### Is it worth buying used IT equipment?
The answer will obviously depend on several factors, such as:   
  
• Age: the older an IT equipment is, obviously the lower the market price will be.  
  
• Condition: fairly self-explanatory, a "healthy" piece of IT equipment will be priced higher compared to IT assets with cosmetics of functional defects.  
  
• Newer model(s) available: IT equipment will typically decrease in price when a direct replacement has been released (i.e., a used iPhone 12 will decrease in price as soon as iPhone 13 has been announced.) If there hasn't been any direct replacement released, even if the IT asset is relatively old, then typically, the price won't go down a lot.   
  
• Rarity: sometimes, very old IT equipment can go up in price if it's no longer available on the market (i.e., for collectors)  
  
This is a non-exhaustive list, and there are other factors that may affect your IT equipment's price. Fortunately, it's now fairly easy to check for the average marketplace of specific IT equipment, as you can simply search for similar goods on sites like Amazon or eBay.   
  
Nevertheless, many people were surprised at the value they can get out of their used IT equipment, so don't be discouraged from selling your used IT equipment even if it may seem too old or too broken at the moment.  
  

##### What types of IT equipment do you buy?

](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/sell-your-i-t-equipment/hard-drives/)And more.  
  
Big Data Supply Inc. understands the dynamic nature of technology advancements, so if you want to sell used IT equipment not listed here, feel free to contact us and provide a detailed list of your equipment.  
  
Whether you have a relatively new, cutting-edge laptop or legacy servers, we’ll assess the compatibility and market demand, and we’ll be happy to let you know if the IT equipment you want to sell falls within our interests.  
  
Our goal is to provide a hassle-free experience, no matter what kind of IT equipment you sell. Rest assured that your IT assets are in good hands with us.
##### How do you determine the value of the IT equipment I'm selling?  

At Big Data Supply Inc., we conduct a meticulous valuation process to determine the value of your IT equipment, and we’ll take several key factors into account:
  * **The make and model of the equipment.** Some brands and models are more popular/in demand than others, which may increase their value when you sell these IT equipment items.


  * **The age and condition of the equipment.** Newer, fully functional equipment that is still in good condition is worth more than older equipment that is in poor condition. 


  * **Current market demand:** Big Data Supply Inc. tracks the current market prices for different types of IT equipment, and we’ll use this information to value the IT equipment you sell us.
  * **Special features or add-ons:** We may value special features or add-ons on your equipment, such as large amounts of memory and high-performance processors. 


We are committed to providing accurate valuations so both parties are satisfied with the quote. Our team of experts will conduct a thorough assessment to ensure a fair and competitive price for each of your IT equipment.
##### How do you ensure data security and proper data wiping for my IT equipment?  

At Big Data Supply Inc., we take data security very seriously, and we’ll prioritize your privacy by using a variety of methods to ensure secure wiping of your data before we resell any of your IT equipment you sell us.
We use the latest technologies and procedures to ensure secure data wiping:
  1. We use advanced data-wiping software to overwrite all data on IT equipment you sell us with random patterns. This makes it impossible to recover the original data through any means. 
  2. For IT equipment that cannot be wiped securely using the software-based approach, we will physically destroy the IT equipment you sell using methods such as shredding or degaussing. This will physically destroy the storage media, so it will be impossible to recover any data.


We offer certificates of data destruction upon request when you sell us used IT equipment, which can help you comply with data privacy regulations as proof that the data on your device has been irrevocably wiped.
##### Are there any fees or costs associated with selling my IT equipment to you?  

In most scenarios, Big Data Supply Inc. covers the costs associated with shipping and handling for the used IT equipment you are selling, particularly for large bulk orders. 
However, in some cases, there may be additional costs required for special services, such as: 
  * On-site data destruction
  * Data migration
  * Asset tagging
  * Custom packaging
  * Expedited shipping


We’ll discuss any potential fees with you upfront, and if you require any of these special services when selling us old IT equipment, we’ll provide you with the appropriate quote before we start the process. 
If you have any questions about costs and fees associated with selling your IT equipment, don’t hesitate to contact us. Our objective is to help you get the best possible value out of your IT equipment while ensuring your data security and privacy.
##### What is the process for selling and shipping the IT equipment? How long does it take?  

The typical process for selling your used IT equipment to Big Data Supply Inc. is as follows: 
  * **Contact us:** You can contact us through our website or via phone and email. We’ll ask for some basic information about your equipment like make, model, age, and condition. If you have a list of your IT equipment to sell, you can email it to us. 
  * **Receive a quote:** Once we’ve collected enough information about your IT equipment, we’ll provide you with a quote. If you agree with the quote, we’ll schedule a pickup date, or alternatively you can ship your equipment to us. 
  * **Prepare your equipment:** Before your equipment is shipped or picked up, please make sure that the package is properly labeled and securely packaged. 
  * **Schedule shipping or pickup:** We’ll work with you to schedule a shipping or pickup date that is convenient for you.
  * **Inspection:** Upon receiving your IT equipment, our team conducts a thorough inspection.
  * **Payment:** Once we’ve inspected and verified your equipment, we’ll process your payment.


The overall duration of this process can vary depending on your location, volume of IT equipment sold, and specific arrangements, among other factors. However you should get your money within 5-7 business days after we’ve successfully received and verified your equipment

WE ARE R2v3 & RIOS CERTIFIED
We’re R2v3 & RIOS certified. This attests to the fact that we recycle old Cisco equipment and follow the best practices tailored to the electronics industry. The ANSI-accredited RIOS certification standard satisfies all requirements from OHSAS:18001 (safety), ISO:9001 (quality), and ISO:14001 (environment).

When you sell Cisco equipment, R2v3 & RIOS guarantee a constant quality of service, everywhere and at any time.
###### Frequently Asked Questions
##### What can you do with old Cisco switches?
Basically, you have three main options with the used Cisco equipment you no longer use:
  1. Dispose of it/recycle it
  2. Repurpose it (i.e., using it on another system or network)
  3. Sell old Cisco equipment for extra cash, which may finance the upgrade


Which one is the best option for your used Cisco equipment? It depends on several key factors:
  * **Condition:** the only options available to you if the Cisco equipment is no longer functional are recycling and disposal. You can still sell Cisco networking equipment or use it for another purpose if it is still functional but not in perfect shape.
  * **Resale value:** selling the Cisco equipment is undoubtedly a feasible choice if its resale value is still relatively high. If the Cisco equipment is in reasonably good condition but has a low resale value, you might be better off finding another use for it.
  * **Replacement cost:** selling Cisco networking equipment too soon when the replacement unit is still too costly could be a problem if you intend to upgrade the Cisco networking equipment unit with a newer model. It is advisable to hold off on selling the old Cisco equipment until the cost of the replacement equipment has decreased.


##### How to determine the value of old Cisco equipment?  

Here are some of the most important factors to take into account when determining the resale value of your Cisco equipment, though the answer may change based on the kind of equipment you are looking to sell and other variables:
  * **Age:** the market price of equipment will decrease with age.
  * **Condition:** the cost of a "healthy" piece of gear will be higher than that of Cisco equipment that has functional or cosmetic flaws.
  * **Newer model(s) available:** when a direct replacement is released, the price of any equipment or technological assets generally drops (for example, the price of a used iPhone 12 will decrease as soon as the iPhone 13 is announced). In most cases, even for relatively old Cisco equipment, there won't be much of a price drop if no direct replacement has been released.
  * **Rarity:** the cost of obsolete equipment may increase if it is no longer sold (for collectors, for instance or if the equipment has specific applications).


There are other factors that could influence the cost of your gear, when you decide to sell used Cisco equipment; this is by no means an exhaustive list. 
Luckily, you can now easily find the average marketplace for a particular kind of Cisco equipment by just searching for comparable ones on websites like Amazon or eBay.
##### How can I sell my Cisco network switches?
Selling your used Cisco networking equipment and making extra money is a feasible option.
When it comes to selling your used Cisco equipment, you essentially have three options, though they may differ based on the type of equipment, where you live, and other variables.
  1. You have the most control over pricing and promoting your Cisco equipment when you find your own buyers on peer-to-peer marketplaces (like eBay), but it can be challenging to locate the right buyer who will purchase the products on your terms. Additionally, selling enterprise-grade Cisco equipment on these markets can be difficult.
  2. List your used Cisco networking gear up for sale on online classified platforms such as Amazon, Craigslist, and Facebook Marketplace. Compared to peer-to-peer marketplaces, these platforms usually make it easier to find buyers, but you'll have less control over the terms and prices you offer.
  3. Sell your used Cisco equipment to specialized IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) companies that buy used networking equipment and other IT assets. This is the fastest and easiest option for selling Cisco equipment, and you can still get a fair market value for your hardware when you sell it. These ITAD companies will also handle secure data erasure if your Cisco equipment holds regulated or sensitive data.


##### How to sell a Cisco switch?
In just a few easy steps, you can essentially sell your Cisco networking equipment, including hubs, routers, gateways, and so on:
**Step 1:** Evaluate the condition
To sell old Cisco equipment, you need to check the condition of the equipment (looking for flaws) as well as its operational efficiency. Verify if the Cisco equipment is still operating as intended. Be honest and make a list of any defects or imperfections you discover.
**Step 2:** Understand your equipment
After verifying that the Cisco equipment is operating as intended, the next stage is to ascertain the precise model of the gear in order to calculate its value.
The process should be quite simple if the equipment has a visible brand/model name or serial number on it.
**Step 3:** Take photos 
To show potential buyers your Cisco networking equipment, take photos of it
If the Cisco equipment has a serial number or model name displayed on it, be sure to note it down. Make sure that any equipment flaws are shown in the photos.
**Step 4:** Find potential buyers
Find prospective buyers by advertising your equipment on classified websites, peer-to-peer networks, or by getting in touch with an ITAD expert business like Big Data Supply Inc.
**Step 5:** Packaging and shipping
Once you've found a buyer, then what's left is to package and ship the Cisco equipment you are selling to the buyer. Some ITAD companies may also offer to pick up your gear on your premises, especially if you are selling in bulk.

###### Frequently Asked Questions
##### What can I do with my used data tapes?  

If you have used data tapes and are wondering how to dispose of them, you have several options. These options not only help you manage your old data tapes efficiently but also contribute to environmental sustainability.  
  
Firstly, one of the most practical options is recycling. Data tapes contain materials that can be reclaimed and reused, making recycling an eco-friendly choice. Many specialized companies offer secure data tape recycling services, ensuring that your data is destroyed in compliance with legal and environmental standards.  
  
Another option is to repurpose the tapes. If the tapes are in good condition, they can be reused for data storage, either within your organization or by donating to a smaller business or educational institute that could benefit from additional storage media.  
  
Selling your used data tapes is also a viable option, particularly if they are in good condition and of a type still in demand. You can sell used data tapes to companies like Big Data Supply, offering you a way to recover some value from your old equipment. We ensure that all data tapes you sell us undergo a thorough data destruction process, guaranteeing the security of any sensitive information previously stored.  
  
Lastly, if your data tapes are damaged or obsolete, proper disposal is crucial. Look for a certified e-waste disposal service that handles data tapes, ensuring safe and environmentally responsible disposal.  
  
Whether you choose to recycle, repurpose or sell used data tapes, each option offers a responsible way to handle your outdated or surplus media while keeping data security and environmental sustainability in mind.  
  
  

##### What types of data tapes do you accept?  

At Big Data Supply, our aim is to cater to a wide array of data storage needs, which is why we accept a wide range of data tapes. Understanding the diverse nature of data storage technologies and their evolution over the years, we ensure that our services cover a broad spectrum of data tape formats.  
  
You can sell us various types of magnetic data tapes including, but not limited to, LTO (Linear Tape-Open) formats ranging from LTO-1 to the latest LTO generations. Additionally, we handle DLT (Digital Linear Tape), SDLT (Super DLT), and DAT (Digital Audio Tape) formats, which have been commonly used in different data storage capacities and environments.  
  
Our services also extend to enterprise-level tape formats such as IBM 3592, 3480, 3490, and 3570 tapes, as well as Oracle StorageTek T10000 and various other 9-track reel tapes. These tapes are often used in larger corporate or institutional settings for extensive data archiving and backup solutions.  
  
Furthermore, we accommodate AIT (Advanced Intelligent Tape) and SAIT (Super AIT) tapes, which are popular in certain industries for their high capacity and compact size.  
  
You can sell data tapes to Big Data Supply, encompassing both older and modern technologies. Our goal is to provide a flexible and comprehensive solution for businesses and individuals looking to sell used data tapes, regardless of the format or generation.  
  
  

##### How do I determine the value of my used data tapes?  

Determining the value of your used data tapes involves considering several key factors, which help in assessing their current market worth. At Big Data Supply, we evaluate data tapes based on criteria that ensure a fair and transparent valuation for your equipment.  
  
One of the primary factors is the type and generation of the data tape. Different types, such as LTO, DLT, SDLT, and others, have varying values based on their storage capacities and technological advancements. Newer generations typically retain more value due to their higher utility in current data storage solutions.  
  
The condition of used data tapes you sell us is another crucial aspect. Tapes that are well-maintained, with minimal signs of wear and tear, and are free from physical damage, often fetch a higher value. The presence of original packaging and documentation can also positively impact the valuation.  
  
The brand and model of the data tape can influence its value as well, with certain brands or models being more sought-after in the secondary market for their reliability and performance reputation.  
  
Market demand and current trends in data storage technology also play a significant role. The need for specific types of data tapes can fluctuate, affecting their resale value.  
  
To get an accurate valuation for used data tapes you want to sell, you can contact us directly at Big Data Supply. Our team of experts will assess your tapes based on these factors, providing you with a competitive and fair quote. This assessment is obligation-free, ensuring you have complete information to make an informed decision.  
  
  

##### Is there a minimum or maximum quantity of data tapes I can sell?  

At Big Data Supply, we understand that our clients' needs vary greatly, which is why we have a flexible approach when it comes to the quantity of data tapes you can sell to us. Whether you have a small number of tapes from a personal collection or a large bulk from a business upgrade or data center clearing, we are ready to accommodate your sale.  
  
For individuals or small businesses with a limited number of data tapes, we offer a straightforward and easy process. Even if it's just a single tape, we value your decision to choose us for selling your equipment and ensure that your experience is as seamless and efficient as our bulk handling processes.  
  
On the other hand, for larger organizations looking to sell used data tapes in bulk, we have the capacity and expertise to manage large-scale transactions. Our team is experienced in handling significant volumes, providing comprehensive support right from valuation to the logistics of handling bulk sales. This is part of our commitment to serving a diverse client base, encompassing individual users, small businesses, and large corporations alike.  
  
In summary, regardless of the number of data tapes you wish to sell, there is no minimum or maximum limit at Big Data Supply. We strive to provide a hassle-free selling experience, ensuring that all our clients, regardless of the scale of their sale, receive the best service and value for their used data tapes.  
  
  

##### What are data tapes used for?
Data tapes (also called "backup tapes", “media tapes” or "storage tapes") are a type of storage technology that utilizes magnetic tape to store data.   
  
As you might have guessed, data tape is a fairly old storage technology, even older than computers. While in the past, data tapes were quite commonly used in personal computers, by the 1980s and 1990s, personal use of data tapes was largely abandoned in favor of more customer-friendly technologies like the CD-ROM (rather, DVD-ROM) and internet-based (cloud) storage.  
  
However, large data tapes are still widely used within enterprises, especially as a part of the HSM (Hierarchical Storage Management) practices.   
  
HSM dictates that data (files and assets) must be moved from more expensive to less expensive storage media, and data tapes offer lower cost per byte of storage when compared to other storage technologies, especially HDDs and SSDs.  

##### Are data tapes still used?
Despite the introduction of newer storage technologies like NVMe SSDs, as well as the rising popularity of cloud storage solutions, data tape (also called "backup tape" or just "storage tape'') remains a popular storage technology.  
  
The data tapes are considered the most cost-effective technology for storing large inactive data. Data tapes offer bigger storage capacity when compared to hard drives (even more, SSDs) at a similar price. The latest generation of LTO (Linear Tape-Open) Ultrium (a popular data tape model) can now hold a whopping 18 terabytes of data in just a single tape cartridge.  
  
A data tape, however, has a slower transfer rate than hard drives and especially SSDs, so it is more geared towards storing inactive data rather than critical data used in day-to-day operations that require frequent data transfers.  
  
Also, data tapes are relatively easier to maintain and are more durable/reliable than standard hard drives. They are relatively compact (easy to store and transport) and cool faster than other types of storage devices.  

##### Where can I sell my used data tapes?
While your options may vary depending on the type of data tapes you are planning to sell, your location, or other factors, basically, you have three major options in selling used data tapes or other types of IT equipment:  
  
1. Finding your own buyers on peer-to-peer marketplaces (like eBay). In this option, you have the most freedom in setting your prices and terms in selling your data tapes, but it can be difficult to find the right buyer willing to purchase the goods at your terms. Also, since data tapes are mainly used in enterprise usage, finding buyers in this type of marketplace can be quite challenging.   
2. Listing your storage tapes for sale on classified sites like Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or even Amazon. It's typically easier to find buyers on these platforms when compared to on peer-to-peer marketplaces, but you'll have less freedom in setting your prices and terms.  
3. Selling tape drives to specialist IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) companies that will take the data tapes off your hands. The easiest and quickest option and you can still sell data tapes at a fair market price. If your data tape contains sensitive/regulated data, these ITAD companies will also perform secure data eradication for you.  

##### How to clean data from media tapes?
Ensuring the secure destruction of your data from data tapes before selling them is crucial for maintaining data privacy and security. There are several effective methods to securely wipe data from your tapes.  
  
Data Degaussing: This is a widely recommended method for data tapes. Degaussing involves using a powerful magnet (degausser) to disrupt the magnetic field on the tape, thereby erasing all data. It's important to note that degaussing should be performed using a degausser that is strong enough for your specific type of tape, as different tapes have different coercivity levels.  
  
Overwriting: Another method is to overwrite the data on the tape. This process involves writing new data over the entire length of the tape, effectively erasing the previously stored information. It's crucial to ensure that the tape is overwritten from end to end, so you can sell used data tapes safely.  
  
Physical Destruction: If the tapes are damaged or you prefer not to reuse them, physical destruction is an option. Specialized services can shred or pulverize the tapes, making data recovery impossible. However, this method is not environmentally friendly and should be used as a last resort.  
  
Professional Data Erasure Services: If you are not equipped to perform degaussing or overwriting yourself, consider using a [secure data erasure service](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/end-of-life-it-solutions/data-destruction/). These services ensure that your data is securely erased, adhering to legal and industry standards.  
  
Remember, regardless of the method you choose, it's essential to verify that all data has been completely erased before you sell used data tapes. This not only protects sensitive information but also ensures compliance with data protection regulations.  
  
  

##### Do I need to delete data from old data tapes before selling?
If your data tapes contain sensitive and/or regulated data, then you'd want to securely delete this data from old data tapes to protect your company's (and your customer's) data privacy.   
  
Depending on your industry and/or location, securely deleting data from your data tapes may be a legal requirement. If you sell used data tapes without ensuring secure data eradication, you may risk facing legal repercussions, and you may also lose your organization's compliance with relevant regulations (i.e., PCI-DSS). If your data is recovered by hackers or cybercriminals, you may also risk ruining your reputation.  
  
A viable and secure option is to sell tape drives to specialist ITAD (IT Asset Disposition) companies.   
  
ITAD companies like Big Data Supply inc. will ensure that the data stored within your data tapes are completely and securely eradicated. Certified/accredited ITAD companies will also give you a Certificate of Data Destruction after purchasing your data tapes.   
  
Depending on your industry and local regulations, a Certificate of Data Destruction may be considered a legal requirement.

###### Frequently Asked Questions
##### Why Sell Your Used Hard Drives?
When you have unused, idle old hard drives lying around, a viable option to maximize the value of the drive is to sell them for extra cash.   
If the hard drive is still in a relatively good condition and not too old with a decent resale value, and yet you don’t want to reutilize it for one reason or another, then it’s better to sell it rather than physically destroying/recycling a hard drive.   
While there’s always the concern of data security when selling old hard drives, it’s possible to securely delete residual data from the hard drive and ensure the data cannot be recovered by anyone with our data destruction solution.  
  

##### Is It Safe To Sell Used Hard Drives?
The main concern of many people when selling their old hard drives is whether the data stored within the sold hard drive can be accessed by the buyer (or other parties after the hard drive was sold). This has caused many people to feel reluctant in selling their used hard drives.  
While it’s true that it’s possible for people with adequate know-how (including hackers and cybercriminals) to recover residual data already erased from the hard drive, there are methods and tools you can use to securely eradicate the data stored within the hard drive and prevent recovery of residual data.  
A viable option to ensure the security of your data (which may be legally required by local legislation) and your privacy is to sell your used hard drives to credible IT asset disposition services like Big Data Supply Inc. that will handle all the needs of securely eradicating the data stored within the hard drive. Big Data Supply Inc. will also provide a certificate of data destruction for each hard drive you sell to us, a formal audit document that can help ensure your organization’s compliance with relevant data security and risk management regulations.  
  

##### What Is The Value of Used Hard Drives?
How much are your old hard drives worth? The answer would vary depending on various different factors including but not limited to:  
Condition: whether there’s any defect (functional or cosmetics), how old the hard drive is, whether it has since been replaced with a faster/better model  
Storage size: hard drive sizes can vary from as small as below 100 GB to more than 16 TB   
Type: traditional HDD (with motorized disk) or SSD (Solid State Drive)  
Brand: Toshiba, Seagate, etc.  
Model: check the manufacturer’s part number  
RPM: (for standard HDD), 5400, 7200, 10k, 15k  
Transfer rate speed: 190 MB/S  
Physical size: 2.5” or 3.5”  
  

##### What Should I Do With My Old Hard Drives?
There are basically three main options you can do with your old hard drives, depending on the hard drive’s reusability and resale value:  
  
Reutilize  
If the old hard drive is still working well, then it’s a viable option to reutilize these old hard drives, for example by using the hard drive in another device, or by converting it into an external drive.  
Before you can reutilize a hard drive, you have to first determine whether the old hard drive is in a good condition. As a general rule of thumb, the drive should not be older than five years and you should also check the drive’s health to ensure it’s still in a good state.  
  
Sell  
If the hard drive is still relatively new and is still in a good condition, it might have a relatively high resale value, so selling the old hard drive for extra cash can be an ideal option.  
The main concern when choosing to sell your used hard drives for extra cash is secure data eradication, but partnering with reliable ITAD vendors like Big Data Supply Inc. can ensure secure data erasure in compliance with ISO standards.  
  
Disposal  
If the old hard drive is both unusable and with a low resale value, then the only viable and secure option is to dispose of or recycle the old hard drive. Physical destruction will 100% ensure that the data on your hard drive won’t be recovered by others.  
A common way to “destroy” your old hard drives is by shredding the hard drive or running the drive through a degausser.  
  

##### How Do You Prepare a Hard Drive for Recycling or Selling?
The answer would depend on many different factors from the type/model of the hard drive and others. However, basically you’ll need to securely wipe the data stored within the drive and make sure the data is unrecoverable. Physical destruction is the safest bet, and you could try many ways to destroy your hard drive before selling it: degaussing/magnets, running over it with your vehicle, etc.   
  
However, you’ll also need to be able to verify whether the data is indeed unrecoverable, and this is why it’s best to recycle or sell your old hard drive to a certified recycler like Big Data Supply Inc. unless you have state-of-the-art equipment to securely wipe the hard drive and verify that the data is unrecoverable.

###### WE ARE R2v3 & RIOS CERTIFIED RAM Memory recycling company
We’re R2v3 & RIOS certified, which is a really big deal. This certifies that we follow the best practices specifically for the electronics industry, electronic waste and RAM memory recycling. RIOS certification is an ANSI accredited standard that meets all processes from ISO:14001 (environment), ISO:9001 (quality), and OHSAS:18001 (safety). R2v3 & RIOS certification is awarded to companies that achieve responsible recycling standards. R2v3 & RIOS assures you of a consistent level of service when you sell your old laptop or computer RAM memory, anywhere and anytime. It also gives you the ability to address challenges, new materials, and new technology, all while developing new services as you grow and evolve.  

###### Frequently Asked Questions
##### How much can I sell used computer RAM memory for?
There is a wide variety of RAM models available in the market: different types of DDR, different brands, different models, etc. Thus, the resale value of your used computer RAM memory can vary depending on the following factors:  
  
Types: most computer RAMs available today are DDR SDRAMs, and there have been five major iterations of DDR SDRAMs over the past two decades. DDR5 is the latest iteration, being very recently released (and still not very common today in 2022), and the other versions are DDR, DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4. Most computers nowadays use DDR4, but there are still those who are still using DDR3 (meaning, DDR3 computer RAMs still have some value).   
  
Capacity: the bigger the capacity of the used computer memory you are looking to sell (in GB), the more expensive the RAM will be.  
  
Size: there are SO-DIMM (Small Outline Dual In-Line Memory Module) for laptops and DIMM for desktops and servers.  
  
Clock Speed: the higher the clock speed (measured in MHz), typically the more expensive the computer RAM memory will be when you sell it.  
  
Bandwidth: whether the computer RAM memory is single-channel, dual-channel, or quad-channel.  
  
Obviously, the condition of the used computer RAM memory would also matter. The better the condition is, the more money you will get when you sell your old computer memory.  
  

##### Where can I sell used server and computer RAM memory?
Basically, you have three major options in selling your used RAM memory:
  1. Finding your own buyers on peer-to-peer marketplaces (like eBay), you have the most freedom in setting your prices and "promoting" your used RAM, but it can be difficult to find the right buyer willing to purchase the RAM(s) at your terms.
  2. Selling your used server and computer RAM memory on classified sites like Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or even Amazon. It's typically easier to find buyers on these platforms when compared to on peer-to-peer marketplaces, but you'll have less freedom.
  3. Selling your used RAM memory to specialist IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) companies that will take the goods off your hands. The easiest and quickest option (and you can still sell your old RAM at a fair market price). If you are planning to sell in bulk, or if you just want to quickly sell your used memory, then selling to an ITAD company may be the most viable option.  
  



##### How can I sell my old RAM memory? 
Basically you can sell your old RAM memory in just a few simple steps: 
**Step 1: Evaluate the condition**
Remove the RAM from your PC, laptop, or server if you haven't already, and then assess its condition. If it's dirty, clean it, and you can clean the contacts with a pencil (rubber) eraser. Simply lay the RAM module down on a flat (and clean) surface, and then rub the eraser in short strokes back-and-forth along with the contacts until it's clean. Wipe the computer or laptop RAM with a clean and dry cloth to remove the eraser fillings.
After it's clean, try reattaching the RAM to your computer to see if it still works. 
**Step 2: Know your RAM module**
If you've confirmed that the RAM module is working properly, then you should identify the RAM module's exact model to determine its resale value. 
If the RAM memory has a visible brand/model name or serial number on it, then this process of selling your used computer, server or laptop memory should be fairly easy. 
**Step 3: Taking pictures**
Take photos of your RAM module(s), so you can show them to prospective buyers. Make sure you capture the RAM module's serial number and model name (if it's visible on the product). It's also important to be honest: if there are any defects on the product, make sure it's captured in the photos.
**Step 4: Finding buyers**
Find prospective buyers, whether listing your used computer, server or laptop memory on classified sites, peer-to-peer marketplaces, or contacting an ITAD specialist company like Big Data Supply Inc.
**Step 5: Packaging and shipping**
Once you've found a buyer, then what's left is to package and ship the RAM module(s) to the buyer. Some ITAD companies may also offer to pick up your goods on your premises, especially if you are selling used computer, server or laptop memory in bulk.  
  

##### Does computer RAM memory hold personal information? 
No, all types of RAM modules used in computers are volatile. Meaning they absolutely need power in order to maintain data. No data is permanently saved in your RAM module, and even if there is any personal information temporarily stored in the RAM module, once the module is unplugged from a computer unit (and loses power), all data stored within is 100% eradicated.  
  

##### What can I do with old computer, server or laptop RAM memory?
Basically, you have three main options with your used RAM modules:
  1. Throw it away/recycle it
  2. Repurpose it (i.e., using it on another computer)
  3. Sell your old computer, server or laptop memory for extra cash


Which one is the best option for your old RAM module? It depends on several key factors:
  * **Condition:** if the RAM unit no longer works well, then your only option is to dispose of it or recycle it. If it's still working but not in perfect condition, you can probably still sell or repurpose the module. 
  * **Resale value:** pretty self-explanatory. If the resale value of the RAM module is still fairly high, then obviously, selling your used RAM memory is a viable option. However, if the resale value is relatively low despite it being in fairly good condition, then you might be better off repurposing the used computer, server or laptop RAM.
  * **Replacement cost:** if you are planning to replace the computer RAM unit with a newer one (upgrade), then selling the used RAM memory too soon when the replacement unit is still too expensive can be an issue. It's better to wait a bit until the replacement RAM module's price has gone off before selling the old computer RAM memory.

With regard to the electronics industry, electronic waste, and the recycling of data center equipment, this attests to our adherence to best practices. An ANSI-accredited standard, RIOS certification satisfies all requirements from ISO:9001 (quality), ISO:14001 (environment), and OHSAS:18001 (safety).  

###### Frequently Asked Questions
##### Is my old data center equipment worth anything?
Your used data center equipment and other seemingly used IT assets are valuable assets that should not be undervalued. 
You should not be discouraged from selling your data center equipment, even if it appears too broken or old in your opinion. Many of our clients have been surprised by the value they were able to obtain from their used data center equipment.
How much value can you get from selling your used data center equipment?
The answer will depend on several different factors, including but not limited to:
  * **Age:** an IT asset's market price will decrease with age.
  * **Condition:** the value of data center equipment in good condition will be higher than that of equipment with functional or visual defects. 
  * **Availability of newer models:** the price of the majority of electronics equipment will drop when a direct replacement is available. The price should stay the same if there isn't a direct replacement for the equipment, even if it is somewhat used.
  * **Rarity:** the scarcity of extremely rare IT assets can drive up their price.


Luckily, these days it should be pretty simple to find the average market price of the used data center equipment you want to sell. To find the average market price for the equipment, you can simply search for similar products on marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, or Craigslist.
##### How can I sell my used data center equipment?
Selling the data center equipment and assets is a fairly easy process:
**Step 1:** send us a list of used data center equipment (servers, hard drives, tape libraries, tape drives, storage tape media, disk arrays, network equipment, and other types of data center IT assets.)
**Step 2:** we'll reply with a quote that includes our suggested price for each piece of used data center equipment.
**Step 3:** once a price has been agreed upon, you have the option to accept the offer or negotiate further. After that, you can package and ship the data center equipment to our location. We can make plans to have the assets picked up from your data center if that's what you'd like.
**Step 4:** the information kept on hard drives and other storage devices will be safely erased. We also provide recycling services for used data center equipment based on your preferences.
**Step 5:** You will be paid after we get the gear, when you sell used data center equipment to us and given data destruction certificates after the data has been safely removed.
##### How will you handle the deletion of confidential/regulated data stored within data center equipment?
In the course of selling used data center equipment, we recognized how crucial it was to safely delete your data.
Based on your requirements and preferences, we can either physically destroy your storage tapes (degaussing, shredding, etc.) or perform secure data deletion using cutting-edge technologies.
Depending on your preferences, we can remove your data or recycle your data center equipment at our location or at your data center. Our RIOS and R2v3 certifications will guarantee that there is no chance of your private data being stolen.
##### How relevant is Big Data Supply Inc.'s R2v3 & RIOS certification?
Big Data Supply Inc. has adhered to industry best practices in buying and selling data center equipment, particularly with regard to secure data management and deletion and the handling of used data center equipment, as evidenced by its RIOS and R2v3 certification.
The ANSI-accredited RIOS certification attests to a company's compliance with ISO:9001 (quality), OHSAS:18001 (safety), and ISO:14001 (environment) standards when it comes to purchasing and selling used data center equipment
Only organizations that have achieved high-level for the responsible recycling of data center equipment are eligible to receive the R2v3 & RIOS certification.
A secure and reliable level of data center equipment recycling service is guaranteed whenever and wherever you use Big Data Supply Inc., a R2v3 & RIOS-certified company that purchases and disposes of your data center IT assets.
##### Will disposal or recycling of data center equipment cost me?
The resale value of your equipment often offsets any related disposal or recycling fees for data center equipment. The weight of the scrap commodity included in the data center IT asset is used to calculate recycling fees, and this weight varies based on volume and value of data center equipment you sell.

###### Frequently Asked Questions
##### What should I do with my old GPU?
There are a few options available to you when it comes to dealing with an older GPU, depending on its age, condition, and other factors. 
While throwing it away may seem like the most straightforward option, it is not the most financially or environmentally responsible course of action. 
Instead, there are several more practical options that can help you extend the lifespan of your GPU or recoup some of your initial investment.
  * **Sell it:** If your used GPU is still in good working condition, you could consider selling it. There are many online marketplaces, forums, and social media profiles dedicated to buying and selling used GPU and other computer hardware. When you sell old GPUs, it can help you recover some of the initial investment you made in the hardware and also extend its lifespan.
  * **Donate it:** Another option is to donate your GPU to charity. Many charities accept donations of old computer hardware, and there might be educational institutions or non-profit organizations in your area that could benefit from your older GPUs or other IT assets. Donating your older GPUs will give you the opportunity to help someone in need and contribute to your community
  * **Repurpose it:** If your old GPU is still in good working condition but is no longer attractive in terms of resale value, you could repurpose it for other uses. For example, you could set up a cryptocurrency mining rig using the old GPU or use it as part of a GPU-powered machine learning or AI development system. You could even repurpose the GPU to set up a media station or a gaming PC.
  * **Recycle it:** If your old GPU is no longer working or you don't want to donate or sell old GPUs, recycling it is the best option. Rather than letting it end up in a landfill, you could check if there are any certified GPU recycling companies in your area that can handle used GPU recycling in an environmentally responsible way. Companies like Big Data Supply Inc. can ensure the recovery of valuable components and safe, environmentally responsible disposal of hazardous materials.


##### Is it safe to sell used GPUs?
If you're looking to get rid of your old graphic card or upgrade to a newer model, selling your used GPU can be a viable option. Yet, it's always important to take certain precautions to ensure not only a successful transaction but also your data privacy and security.
Here are some tips to keep in mind:
  * Before trying to sell used GPUs, make sure to thoroughly assess the condition of it. Use appropriate diagnostic tools to test whether the GPU is functioning properly and check for any physical defects.
  * If you sell old GPUs along with a computer that includes storage devices (HDDs, SSDs, etc.), be sure to format them and use data erasure software if necessary.
  * Take clear and high-quality photos of the GPU from different angles to show its condition and any defects. This can help potential buyers make informed decisions and protect you in case of disputes. It’s best to be honest about its condition. Don’t try to hide defects or performance issues to avoid future issues. 
  * Package the GPU securely with adequate packing material and a sturdy box to prevent damage during shipping.
  * If you're shipping the GPU yourself, opt for a shipping method that includes insurance and tracking to protect both you and the buyer.
  * Sell used GPUs to a trusted ITAD company like Big Data Supply Inc. to reduce the potential risks involved in selling to an individual buyer.


##### Where can I sell my used GPU?  

If you are looking to sell your used GPUs, there are several viable options available. Here are a few possibilities you can consider:
  1. **Private Buyers:** You may have friends or family members who are interested in purchasing your used GPU. However, it's important to exercise caution when you sell used GPUs to individuals, even if you know them personally.
  2. **Trade-in Programs:** Some retailers and GPU manufacturers offer trade-in programs for used GPUs. This can be a great option if you're planning to upgrade your GPU and want to offset the cost.
  3. **Online Marketplaces** : Popular online marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, and Craigslist are great platforms to sell used GPUs to potential buyers.
  4. **Dedicated Hardware Marketplaces:** Hardware marketplaces like Newegg and Hardware Swap cater specifically to tech enthusiasts and can be a great option for selling your used GPU.
  5. **ITAD Companies and Resellers:** Certified ITAD companies and IT equipment resellers like Big Data Supply Inc. offer competitive prices and handle the entire process for you, including secure data erasure and pickup services. This option is especially great if you are selling used GPUs in bulk.
  6. **Local Computer Stores:** If you want to sell your old hardware quickly, many local computer stores buy and resell used GPUs. However, keep in mind that you may not get the most competitive price.


##### What to do before selling your old GPU?
If you're planning to sell used GPUs, below are some important precautions you can take to ensure a successful and safe transaction: 
  1. **Clean and Inspect the GPU** : Before you list your used GPU for sale, make sure to thoroughly clean the unit. You can use isopropyl alcohol and a soft cloth to clean the GPU’s exterior. Also, make sure to inspect the graphics card to see whether there’s any damage or physical defect. Keeping your GPU in a presentable condition can help attract potential buyers.
  2. **Test the GPU:** Before you sell old GPUs, it's always best to test the performance. You can use benchmark software like FurMark or 3DMark to do this. Another option is to run a few games or benchmarks to test the GPU's performance manually. Make sure to document your findings to help present the GPU to potential buyers and settle any disputes later.
  3. **Set a Fair Price:** To get the most out of your used GPU while selling it, you need to set a fair price. Do your research and see the market price of similar GPUs. Consider factors like its age, condition, and current performance to set a reasonable price.
  4. **Take High-Quality Photos:** Taking high-quality and presentable photos of your used GPU is highly important and can make or break your effort to attract any potential buyers. Take clear and detailed pictures that highlight the graphics card's conditions and features. Be honest about any damages or defects to avoid any future disputes.
  5. **Ensure Secure Packaging:** If you plan to ship the used GPU, make sure to use a sturdy box or appropriate packaging materials to protect it from any damage during transport. You can also use cushioning materials inside the box to add further protection to the old GPU unit.


##### How many years does GPU last?  

As with any technology, the lifespan of a GPU can vary considerably depending on a number of factors, including the make and model of the GPU, how it is used, the environment in which it is located, and the quality of the hardware itself. 
On average, however, a well-maintained GPU can last anywhere from three to five years. With exceptional care, some GPUs can last for eight years or more. On the other hand, factors such as overheating, stress, and overclocking can all significantly reduce the GPU’s lifespan.
Besides its physical condition and performance, however, it’s also important to take into account the rapid advancements of graphics-intensive applications and video games. As these programs become more demanding, even a well-maintained GPU may not be able to keep up, thus shortening its practical and effective lifespan. So, it might be a good option to sell old GPUs and replace them with new ones.
To maximize the lifespan of your GPU, there are a few key steps you can take:
  * **Keep your GPU clean:** Dust and debris can accumulate inside your GPU, causing it to overheat and perform poorly. Regularly clean both your computer and your GPU with a can of compressed air to keep it running smoothly.
  * **Optimize airflow:** Make sure your GPU is well-ventilated by ensuring proper heat management and airflow in your computer case. Invest in a good case fan or even advanced heat management technologies like liquid cooling to keep your system running cool.
  * **Avoid overclocking:** While overclocking can give you a boost in performance, it can also significantly shorten the lifespan of your GPU and decrease its resale value in case you decide to sell used GPUs in the future. Unless you have a specific need for overclocking, it is best to avoid it and stick with the manufacturer's recommended settings.


##### How much does an old GPU cost?
When trying to sell old GPUs or upgrade them with newer models, you might wonder about the value of your old graphics card and how much you could sell it for. 
Generally speaking, the average price of a used GPU drops by 50% of its initial value in the first year after its release and then continues to decrease at a slower rate. Over the next two years, you can expect the used GPU to lose around 25% of its value. 
In terms of pricing, older GPUs can range from less than $50 for outdated or entry-level models to over $1,000 for high-end or sought-after old GPUs. 
To summarize, there are three main factors influencing the value of your old GPU:
  * **Age** : As expected, older GPUs decrease in value more quickly than newer ones. Additionally, when a direct replacement model is released, the GPU's value will decline faster.
  * **Condition** : The condition of the used GPU can also impact its value. A GPU that is still performing optimally will depreciate more slowly than one that is damaged or in poor condition. So, it is important to consider the condition before you sell used GPUs.
  * **Demand** : Finally, the demand for a GPU model can have a significant impact on its price. GPUs that are highly sought-after will depreciate more slowly (and may even appreciate in value), while low-demand or obsolete models will lose value more quickly.

###### Frequently Asked Questions
##### Should You Sell Your Used Servers?
All good things must come to an end, and this is especially true for your businesses servers. However, many times business owners are not aware of when they should sell their used servers. Do you sell it when it completely shuts down or when you notice things are slower?  
  
If you do decide to sell the used servers, then how would you go about accomplishing this?  
  
These are questions that are brought to us all the time. Today we are going to give you advice on what to look out for to determine if you should sell your used servers.  
  
**Security**  
  
When it comes to technology, you should stay up-to-date. Older servers are more susceptible to hacks, viruses, and malware. If your systems are older, it would be wise to sell your used servers and buy a new one. This is especially true if your corporation plans to expand. As you take on more customers, it is crucial for you to increase security measures by buying newer technology that can handle the expansion.  
  
**Performance**  
  
Have you noticed your system is running a bit slower? Well, this could mean you are due for an upgrade! You can trade in your old servers and buy new ones. This way the cost of replacing them is much lower. When your system is running faster, your employees are more productive and efficient throughout the day. Having a higher performing server can help your business tremendously!  
  
**Space**  
  
Need more space? Then sell those old servers that you are not using. If they are just sitting there collecting dust in a warehouse or equipment room, you might as well clear it out to make extra room for employees to work or to create more storage space. You can also make a second revenue channel if you do opt to sell used servers.  
  
**Value**  
  
When you sell your server at a time when it is still running versus when it crashes it will yield a higher value. You can sell it for money and make your investment back because it is still useful. When it crashes the value of the server drops significantly. Also, waiting until your server crashes can cause the business to stop operations, and this ultimately could cost the company a lot of capital!  
  
**How to sell the used servers?**  
  
You can sell them with us!!! We are more than happy to buy your used servers from you. Big Data Supply also offers a wide variety of servers you can buy to replace the ones you are selling.

Fill out the contact form and we will reach out to you as soon as possible.  
  

##### Are old servers worth anything?
The answer to this question will depend on several key factors, but basically, it's about supply and demand: if someone is still willing to buy your server, then it should be worth something.
Fortunately, in this internet age, it's now fairly easy to determine the resale value of your server (or any IT equipment): simply check for similar used units on marketplaces like eBay or Amazon and look at the average market price. 
To do so, you need to identify several key factors:
  * **Brand:** some brands are more popular (and in-demand) than others, and so they may have higher resale value. Popular brands for servers are IBM, HPE, and Dell.
  * **Model:** some models are more expensive than others (i.e., some brands may differentiate their models into different tiers).
  * **Age:** when the server was released by the manufacturer. The newer a server is, the higher the resale value will be.
  * **Condition:** whether the used server is still performing well, whether there's any defect, etc. Obviously, the better the condition is, the more expensive it will be.


If there's any visible serial/part number on the server unit, then you can simply Google the serial number to determine the brand/generation/model of the server, so you'll only need to assess its condition.
##### How do you sell a corporate server?
A crucial consideration when selling a used corporate server is that depending on the industry you're in, you may be subject to specific regulations, and you'll need to consider:
  * **Secure data eradication:** if your server contains sensitive/regulated data, you'll need to ensure data stored within the server has been securely wiped and is unrecoverable. If you are in a heavily regulated industry, you may be required to obtain a Certificate of Data Destruction to ensure compliance.
  * **Sustainability:** you may also need to ensure compliance with relevant sustainability regulations and standards. You may be required to only sell to accredited ITAD (IT Asset Disposition) companies with R2v3 & RIOS certifications, or companies with ISO 14001 accreditation.
  * **Audit trail:** you may be required to keep full documentation of the server's lifecycle from the moment you've purchased the server until it's sold or disposed of.


You must take every care to sell or dispose of your used servers securely, or you may risk facing hefty legal fines and damaging your business's reputation. 
The easiest and most viable way to sell your used corporate server is to sell through an accredited ITAD company like Big Data Supply Inc., which specializes in secure data erasure, recycling, transport, and proper documentation of used IT assets. 
**How long does a server last?**
Provided the hardware is maintained well, the average lifespan of servers is around 5 to 8 years. Most organizations and individuals tend to start looking to sell their existing servers after the 5-year mark, but when maintained well and if it's installed in a good physical environment, a server can last up to 8 years before you may need to start looking for a replacement.
Also, you may not need to sell or replace the whole server. A server's hard drives tend to be the first ones to fail, so you can simply replace the existing hard drive with a new one to prolong the server's lifespan. If the server uses traditional HDDs (with spinning motorized disks), you may want to switch the HDD with a new one around the 4-year mark. However, if the server is using newer SSDs (Solid State Drives), you may be able to stretch the drive's lifespan a bit further.
Also, keep in mind that the value of hard drives tends to go down faster than the actual server unit, so it's typically better to swap and sell the old hard drives earlier (around four years in).
##### Can servers be recycled?
Yes, servers can be recycled, and there are ITAD companies like Big Data Supply Inc. that are certified for eco-friendly server recycling and asset management.  
  
While we'd recommend selling the old, unused server for extra cash, there are indeed cases where recycling is the best (at least, the preferred) option for the server's owner.   
  
When recycling a server, however, it's crucial to consider that electronic waste may pose a potential environmental threat, and you may be subject to specific environmental regulations. Your server may contain toxic materials, including but not limited to lead, beryllium, cadmium, mercury, and hexavalent chromium.   
  
Not to mention, improper recycling and/or disposal of your server may result in the data stored within the drives being recovered via partial data recovery and accessed by unwanted parties.   
  
With that being said, if you do decide to recycle or sell your old server, it's crucial to choose an ITAD specialist vendor that is certified for responsible recycling as well as secure data eradication.  
  
By selling your used servers to an expert, you will know that your servers will be recycled appropriately and your data is totally safe from hackers and cybercriminals, giving you peace of mind.  
  

##### Where can I sell used servers?
You have three major options in selling your old and/or unused server:
  1. Finding your own buyers on peer-to-peer marketplaces (like eBay). You have the most freedom in setting your prices and "promoting" your used server, but it can be difficult to find the right buyer willing to purchase the goods at your terms. 
  2. Listing your used server unit(s) on classified sites like Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or even Amazon. It's typically easier to find server buyers on these platforms when compared to on peer-to-peer marketplaces, but you'll have less freedom in setting your own price and terms.
  3. Selling your servers to specialist IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) companies that will take the IT equipment off your hands. The easiest and quickest option (and you can still sell your used server at a fair market price). A crucial aspect to consider is that these ITAD companies will also perform secure data eradication for you, which is important since your servers will most likely contain sensitive and/or regulated data.

###### Frequently Asked Questions
##### What is the best way to sell used computer parts?
You have basically three main options when it comes to selling used computer equipment and parts:  
- Finding your own buyer (i.e., by advertising them on Craigslist)  
- Listing your goods on online marketplaces like eBay  
- Selling your used computer parts to specialist ITAD companies like Big Data Supply Inc.  
  
Out of the three, selling old computer parts to an ITAD company offers the most benefits. The ITAD company will do everything for you, including performing certified processes for securely wiping data from your used computer equipment (especially storage drives.) When needed, Big Data Supply Inc. would also be able to provide a Certificate of Data Destruction, which may be legally required in your industry.  
  
Especially if you are in a regulated industry or if you are selling used computer parts in bulk, selling to a specialist ITAD company is the best option.  
  

##### How to find out how much my used computer equipment costs?
The value of your used computer parts can vary depending on several factors, including:  
  
**Age** : the older the used computer equipment is, the lower its market price will be  
**Condition** : used computer parts in good condition will be priced higher compared to those with functional or cosmetic defects  
**Availability of newer models:** most computer equipment will decrease in price when a direct replacement has been released. If there isn't any direct replacement for the equipment (even if it's fairly old), the price should remain stable.  
**Rarity:** very rare used computer parts can go up in price due to scarcity.  
  
Fortunately, nowadays, finding out the market price of your used computer equipment is fairly easy. You can simply search for similar goods on market price sites like eBay, Amazon, or even Craigslist and check how much others sell old computer parts for.  
  

##### How to delete all the data from used computer equipment?
Before selling any used computer equipment that stores data (HDD, SSD, etc.,) it's crucial to make sure all data (especially confidential and/or regulated information) is securely and completely erased from the IT equipment.   
  
Ensuring data security and integrity is not only important for protecting your customer's information, but failure to do so may also cause legal repercussions for your business.  
  
There are various methods you can use to perform secure data wiping by yourself before selling used computer parts, and the basic ones are:  
  
For HDDs:   
  
On Windows:   
  
Run Windows Disk Management. Click Start->Run, then type diskmgmt.msc in the box  
Select the drive to be formatted  
Uncheck the "perform a quick format" checkbox, and select NTFS  
Format the drive three times to make sure it's totally clean  
  
On macOS  
  
Go to the Utilities folder and run Disk Utility (you can open the Utilities folder by hitting Apple+Shift+U together)  
Select the drive to be formatted, and click erase  
Repeat the process three times  
  
For SSDs:  
  
Most of the well-known SSD manufacturers offer their own disk management solutions that you can use to perform secure wiping. Another option is to use third-party solutions like Blancco Drive Eraser (free with premium version) as well as other free and paid options available out there.  
  
If you are selling old computer parts and equipment to companies specializing in bulk-buying IT equipment (including hard drives), they will securely wipe your data for you. Some buyers may also hire a third-party specialist for this purpose.   
  
This is why selling used computer parts to specialists like Big Data Supply.Inc is preferred, so you don't have to worry about performing secure data deletion by yourself.  
  

##### What should be deleted from computer equipment before selling?
In general, you should delete all data before selling your used computer equipment.   
  
If you don't wipe your data before you sell used computer equipment, the new owner (and potentially bad actors) could gain access to this data.  
  
However, it's especially important to wipe any sensitive/confidential/regulated data, including but not limited to:  
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like full name, address, phone number, etc., especially customer's PII  
- Health and genetic data  
- Biometric data  
- Banking and credit card details  
- Files that can be used against your business or your reputation as an individual  
  

##### What should I do with my old computer equipment?
Basically, with any old, used and/or unused computer equipment, you have three basic options:  
  
**Recycle/dispose of** : if the old computer equipment has low resale value, no longer functions well, or if you consider it too risky to sell (i.e., if it contains sensitive data), then you can dispose of the computer parts after arranging physical destruction or recycling.  
**Repurpose** : if the old computer parts are still in good condition (can function properly but has relatively low resale value, you can repurpose it. For example, you can turn an HDD into an external drive A.  
**Sell old computer parts** : the option to take if your used computer parts and equipment still has a high enough resale value and if you are confident about secure data deletion. If you sell used computer parts and equipment to specialist ITAD vendors like Big Data Supply Inc., you don't have to worry about having to securely wipe your data.

# An Ultimate Guide on Selling Your Used RAM Memory
RAM, or Random Access Memory, is a critical component in most computer systems today. Whether it’s a desktop computer, a laptop, a server, or even a mobile device, chances are it has at least one RAM as its essential component, and the RAM’s performance would play a significant impact on the device’s performance.
Yet, like any other electronic component, RAMs are continually evolving, and newer, faster, and more powerful RAM modules are regularly introduced to the market. Meaning, a good RAM module you’ve just purchased today may become obsolete in just a couple of years or so. 
This situation results in a surplus of older RAM modules that are no longer needed, and of course, selling this RAM memory is a viable way to make some extra money and recoup some of your investment in the computers.
[![Sell used RAM banner](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Sell-used-RAM-banner-1024x452.jpg)](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/sell-your-i-t-equipment/ram-memory/)
Yet, although selling RAM memory can be profitable, it is critical for sellers to be aware of the potential challenges and take the necessary steps to overcome them. This is where this guide comes in. 
This ultimate guide on selling using RAM memory will explore everything you may need to know when selling your used RAM memory, and will cover:
  * The steps you should take before selling your RAMs
  * The various selling options available
  * Tips and best practices to make the most of your sale


By following this guide, you can sell your used RAM memory effectively to maximize its ROI. 
## When to sell your used RAM memory?
Deciding when to sell your RAM can actually be a daunting task if you don’t know what you’re looking for, and there are several factors you should consider:
  * **Upgrades:** if you are looking to upgrade your computer’s RAM to a newer model (i.e., [DDR4 to DDR5](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/ddr5-vs-ddr4-is-it-time-to-upgrade-your-ram)) or a higher capacity, then you will have surplus used RAM modules you won’t use. In this scenario, you should try to sell these surplus modules as soon as possible before they lose their value further. If you’ve upgraded your RAM and have your older RAM lying around for some time, then you should definitely try to [sell your old DDR4 memory](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/sell-your-i-t-equipment/ddr4-ram-memory/).
  * **End of life:** it’s quite possible that your computer or device is already reaching the end of its life (i.e., it’s too slow for today’s demands,) but the RAM modules are actually still usable. In such cases, you may decide to repurpose the RAM modules, [used CPU](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/sell-your-i-t-equipment/sell-cpu/) and [used GPU](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/sell-your-i-t-equipment/sell-gpu/) or sell them before disposing of the computer.
  * **Changing needs:** your computing requirements may change over time. For example, you may decide to change from a desktop Windows PC to a Mac laptop. In this case, you may decide to sell the desktop PC, including the RAM modules inside it to recoup some money.
  * **Value:** how old the RAM module is and how functional it is can definitely affect its resale value. If the resale value is still relatively high, then you should definitely try to sell your RAM module. Or else (i.e., if it’s no longer functional,) then disposal or recycling might be a more viable option. 
  * **Market demands:** the demand for the specific RAM memory model you’ve owned can fluctuate over time, which may affect its value. It may be more beneficial to sell during high-demand periods. For example, during the back-to-school season, more families are purchasing new computers, and there may be an increased demand for used RAM modules. 


## Potential challenges when selling RAMs
While [selling your used RAM memory](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/sell-your-i-t-equipment/ram-memory/) can be a great way to recoup some of the RAM’s value and make some extra money, there are some challenges the sellers may face, including:
  * As discussed above, determining the RAM’s value can be difficult. You may need to consider various different factors, including age, condition, brand, model, and type. Overpricing the RAM will make it harder for you to find a buyer while undervaluing it can result in your loss. 
  * Since used RAM memory belongs to a niche market, finding the right buyer on your own can be a challenge. 
  * Competition from other sellers may be prominent, making it harder to sell your RAM memory quickly. 
  * Selling electronics—including RAMs—via online marketplaces like Amazon or eBay can be tricky since you’ll need to convince potential buyers that you are selling a genuine and functional product.
  * If you are selling in bulk (i.e., when closing an office or data center), then it may even be more challenging since RAM modules are often sold in smaller quantities.
  * RAM modules are fragile by nature, so shipping and delivery can be a major challenge, even if you do find a buyer. You may need to invest in special packaging or conduct special handling to ensure safe arrival, which will translate into additional costs. 
  * If the RAM memory has not been properly wiped, there is a risk of data leaks or data privacy breaches. This can lead to serious consequences for both the seller and the buyer. 


## Where to sell your used RAM memory?
If you are looking to sell your used RAm memory, then there are several selling options available, each with its own pros and cons. The best option for you will depend on your unique circumstances, like the number or RAMs you are looking to sell, your location, and so on. 
Below are your main options:
  1. **Selling to friends, family, and colleagues (or other individual buyers)**


This option involves finding your own buyer by offering your RAM modules around.
If you have friends, family members, or colleagues looking for a used RAM module, then this can be a viable and straightforward option for you, especially if you are not looking to sell in bulk. 
Technically, this will be the most flexible option, and there are no commissions or fees you’ll need to worry about. However, obviously, your options are limited, and with the negotiations that are commonly involved, this may not result in the highest prices for you. 
  1. **Selling to local computer stores**


Another viable option for selling your used RAM memory modules is to offer them to local computer stores near you.
These computer stores can be a great option if you are selling just one or a few modules, and they typically offer fast transactions, even in cash. 
However, these stores are understandably looking to make their profits from reselling your RAM modules or using them as replacement parts, so the prices offered by these stores will typically be lower than the other selling options. 
Not to mention, not all of these local stores might be interested in buying your goods, so you may end up needing to visit several different stores before you can finally sell your RAM memory.
  1. **Selling to online marketplaces**


In this digital age, selling to online marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, or Craigslist allows you to reach a wider range of potential buyers, and if you are using popular marketplaces, they will also offer many resources to facilitate secure and safe transactions.
However, these platforms often offer strict selling policies, and you may need to pay fees. Not to mention, competition with other sellers can be high, so it can take a long time before you can get any buyer.
  1. **Selling to ITAD companies**


If you are planning to sell your RAM modules in bulk, or if data security and compliance are major concerns for you, then selling to a [R2v3 & RIOS certified recycling company like Big Data Supply Inc.](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/) may be the most viable option for you. 
ITAD (IT Asset Disposition) companies are businesses that specialize in buying, recycling, and reselling [used IT assets and electronic equipment](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/sell-your-i-t-equipment/), including [Cisco equipment](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/sell-your-i-t-equipment/cisco-equipment/) and RAM memory. These companies have the infrastructure and various tools to facilitate:
  * Secure data erasure, ensuring any data stored within your RAM is unrecoverable
  * Environmentally responsible recycling and/or disposal processes, in case your RAM modules need to be recycled
  * Thorough testing of your RAM modules to accurately assess their value, for example, by checking the RAM module for any defects or issues


Selling to an ITAD company may be the most hassle-free option for you, and in most cases, they’ll offer a fair price for your goods. Many ITAD companies also offer pick-up services and on-site data erasure services, further adding more convenience to this option.
However, many ITAD companies have requirements for the minimum quantity (or maximum quantity) of IT assets—including RAMs—that they will purchase. Some also may have specific requirements for the RAM memory’s condition. Yet, despite these downsides, selling to ITAD vendors is typically the best and most profitable option for those looking to sell RAM memory in bulk.
## What to do before selling your RAM modules?
Before selling your used RAM memory, there are a few preparation steps you should take to ensure:
  * Your used RAM module is in the most optimal condition (i.e., clean and functional)
  * Your RAM module is compatible with the buyer’s devices to prevent returned goods
  * You get the best possible value out of your used RAM memory


Here are the steps you should take:
**1. Check the RAM’s compatibility**
Once you’ve found a buyer, ask them about the computer/device they are planning to use the RAM in. If it’s a PC, then ask for their motherboard model.
RAM memory comes in different types, capacities, models, and speeds, so it’s important to make sure your used RAM module is compatible with the buyer’s device.
Once you’ve got the buyer’s motherboard or laptop model, you can check the user manual online or use tools like Crucial’s System Scanner to check the compatibility of the RAM with the buyer’s device.
**Note:** if you are selling to an ITAD company, then you can skip this step since they’ll do this step for you. 
**2. Cleaning the RAM**
RAM modules naturally accumulate dust and debris during use over time, and they will affect the RAM’s performance. 
With that being said, make sure to clean the RAM thoroughly before selling it to ensure it’s in optimal condition. 
There are various techniques you can use to clean the RAM, but the basic steps are:
  * Once the RAM module is removed from the computer, handle them by the edges and avoid touching the pins (or other exposed components.)
  * Use compressed air (if any) to remove any dust and debris from the RAM. Alternatively, you can use a soft and dry cloth for this purpose. Make sure to clean both sides of the RAM module.
  * For stubborn dirt or stains, use a cotton swab or toothbrush (make sure the bristles are soft) to clean the RAM. Do _not_ use any liquids, including chemicals, as they may severely damage the RAM module. 


During this cleaning process, also make sure to check for any physical damage. If there’s any, make sure, to be honest with the buyer rather than being sorry later. 
**3. Determine your price**
Pricing your used RAM module, unfortunately, can be quite challenging in practice. The value of your RAM can vary depending on various factors, such as age, condition, brand, capacity, speed, and others. 
However, here are a few tips: 
  * Check online marketplaces and look for listings of the same RAM model (or similar ones). Note their condition and age when checking their prices. 
  * Check these marketplaces for trends and demands for the type of RAM module you are looking to sell. If there’s high demand, you may be able to charge more, and vice versa.
  * Check the brand and model of your RAM. Some brands/models may be more in demand at the moment than others, which may affect your price. Again, check online marketplaces to see which brands and models are currently in demand. 
  * In general, faster RAM with higher capacity will be more expensive than slower/lower-capacity RAMs from the same brand.
  * Check the physical and functional condition of the RAM. RAM with signs of wear and tear will typically be worth less than a pristine RAM in near-perfect physical condition.
  * Check the warranty status. If the RAM is still under warranty, it may be worth more. Check the manufacturer’s website or any documentation for the validity of the warranty.


## Tips for ensuring a successful sale
Once you’ve completed the preparation steps above, in most cases selling the used RAM module will be a straightforward process. However, to ensure a successful and seamless transaction, here are some actionable tips you can consider:
  1. **Include accurate product description**


Whether when offering your RAM modules to individual buyers, offering the goods to an ITAD vendor, or listing the RAMs for sale, make sure to provide accurate and complete product descriptions. Make sure it’s easy for potential buyers to find information about the RAM’s brand, model, speed, capacity, serial number, and so on. 
It’s also important, to be honest about the condition of the RAM. Mention any physical defects, even if it’s a small scratch or dent. 
  1. **High-quality photos**


Include well-taken photos of the RAM. High-quality photos or images can help attract potential buyers, so make sure to take clear photos with a decent camera from multiple angles. Take photos of any labels or markings on the RAM, and if there are any defects, also take photos of them. 
  1. **Offer warranty or return policy**


Consider offering a reasonable return policy or warranty to show that you believe in the quality and condition of your used RAM. Offering a return policy can give potential buyers added confidence in purchasing your used RAM module. 
  1. **Be responsive**


When potential buyers have any questions or inquiries about your RAM, make sure to respond quickly and promptly. Buyers are more likely to purchase goods they deem trustworthy, and being responsive alone can help you establish trust and credibility. 
  1. **Guarantee secure shipping and delivery**


If you have to handle shipping on your own, make sure to package the RAM modules securely to prevent damage during delivery. Make sure to use a reputable shipping carrier that also offers insurance options and tracking to ensure safety.
By incorporating these tips, you can help ensure a successful transaction and delivery of your used RAM module. Yet, also make sure to price it competitively so you can attract more potential buyers. 
## Selling to an ITAD company: what you need to know
If you are looking to sell RAM memory modules in bulk or if you want to sell your goods hassle-free, then in most cases selling to an [ITAD company](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/end-of-life-it-solutions/it-asset-disposition-services/) like Big Data Supply Inc. is the best and most profitable option, where you can expect the following benefits: 
  1. **Hassle-free process:** in most cases selling to an ITAD company means they’ll handle all aspects of the sale: evaluating the goods, performing secure data erasure when needed, picking up the goods, packaging, shipping, and so on. Thus, selling to an ITAD company is most likely a hassle-free process. 
  2. **Secure data wiping or physical destruction:** ITAD companies have the infrastructure, equipment, and manpower to perform secure data erasure from IT assets, including RAM modules. Depending on your industry and location, secure data destruction may be a legal requirement. If necessary, the ITAD company can help perform physical destructions of your RAM modules to ensure complete data security and compliance with regulations. 
  3. **Responsible disposal or recycling:** in circumstances where your RAM modules or other IT assets must be recycled or disposed of, ITAD companies can perform environmentally sustainable disposal of your RAM modules or recycle them. With their expertise and resources to perform responsible recycling or disposal, they can help reduce the negative impact on the environment. 
  4. **Fair prices:** reputable ITAD companies will offer competitive prices for used IT assets, including RAMs. Typically they have a large network of potential buyers, so they can purchase your goods at a good price. Not to mention, they have the tools and infrastructure to test and verify the condition of your RAM accurately. 


However, to get these benefits, it’s critical to choose _the right_ ITAD company that can guarantee fair pricing, data security, and a hassle-free process. In a worst-case scenario, choosing the wrong ITAD vendor may result in you being scammed by the company and losing your goods while not getting any money at all. 
With that being said, here are some important factors to consider when choosing an ITAD vendor:
  * **Reputation and experience:** choose an ITAD company that has been in the business for quite some time, and has a good reputation. You can check online reviews and testimonials from previous sellers or clients to check whether they had positive experiences with the ITAD vendor.
  * **Certifications:** look for an ITAD company that possesses relevant certifications, including: 
    * **R2v3 & RIOS: ** the R2v3 & RIOS (Responsible Recycling) certification is an important standard for recyclers of electronic equipment. This certification ensures that the ITAD company has followed strict guidelines for the responsible handling, recycling, and disposal of electronics.
    * **RIOS:** RIOS (Recycling Industry Operating Standard) certification is a comprehensive certification that covers environmental, safety, health, and quality standards required by the electronic recycling industry.
    * **ISO 9001:2015:** The ISO 9001:2015 certification is a standard that demonstrates a company’s commitment to providing high-quality services. An ITAD company with this certification has implemented high-quality management practices. 
  * **Services offered:** Check what services are offered by the ITAD company. For example, not all ITAD vendors offer secure data destruction services. 
  * **Customer service quality:** Look for an ITAD company that offers good customer service, ideally 24/7 customer support across multiple channels (chat, phone, email, etc.)


## Wrapping up
Selling your used RAM memory can help you recoup your investment in the RAM modules, and you can also clear out some clutter in your IT Asset inventory. 
While there are various options for selling your RAM modules, as well as [selling used laptops](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/sell-your-i-t-equipment/sell-laptops/), [desktops](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/sell-your-i-t-equipment/sell-desktops/) and [tablets](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/sell-your-i-t-equipment/sell-tablets/), in most cases selling to ITAD companies like Big Data Supply Inc. stands out as the best option, especially when selling in bulk. Yet, it’s still important to do your due diligence when choosing between different ITAD companies, and check their reputation and certifications when making your decision.

# What is LTO Tape and How it Works?
LTO, or Linear Tape-Open, is a format of data storage tape that is widely used all around the world. 
LTO, at the moment, is the most popular data tape format mainly due to its massive storage size, with the latest iteration (LTO-9) capable of holding 18 terabytes of data in a single tape. However, LTO is also highly scalable and adaptable.
In this guide to LTO tapes, we will learn all you need to know about the LTO tape format, including:
  * What is LTO?
  * A brief history of the LTO format
  * Specifications of LTO 
  * Why use the LTO format, and when can it be beneficial?


And more.
Without further ado, let us begin with the basics: what is LTO?
## What is LTO?
LTO stands for Linear Tape-Open, and is a format (or technology) of magnetic data tape storage developed in the late 1990s by IBM, HP, and Seagate (that formed the LTO Consortium. LTO is designed as an open standard, and the standard form-factor of the LTO technology is called Ultrium (hence, LTO Ultrium.)
The magnetic data tape storage technology has actually been around since the 1950s, with the half-inch magnetic tape, IBM 7 track, and later IBM 9 track being the pioneering data tape format back then. 
The medium continued to evolve until the late 1990s. By then, Quantum’s Digital Linear Tape (DLT) and Sony’s Advanced Intelligent Tape (AIT) were the two leading options for high-capacity data tape storage for PC servers and enterprise-grade UNIV systems. Both formats were tightly controlled by their owners, so there was practically no competition, driving their prices high.
The LTO Consortium was formed by IBM, HP, and Seagate to add more competition to this market, and the initial plan was to launch to LTO formats: Ultrium, planned as a single-reel, half-inch tape and Accelis with 8mm tape on dual reels. The plan was to optimize Ultrium for capacity and Accelis for speed and low latency. However, only Ultrium was ever produced for the mass markets.
LTO Ultrium has grown to be a very popular data storage tape format. In 2000, the first iteration of Ultrium was introduced with a 100 GB native capacity, although initially, it was going to be available with 10 GB, 30 GB, and 50 GB cartridges too, but scrapped. 
## Different generations of LTO tapes
As of 2021, there are nine generations of LTO Ultrium tapes (LTO-1 to LTO-9) commercially available in the market, and five more (LTO-10 to LTO-14) are planned. 
You can see the details and differences between these different LTO formats in the table below:
**Format** | **Release Date** | **Uncompressed Capacity** | **Compressed Capacity** | **Max Compressed Speed (MB/s)** | **Max Uncommpressed Speed (MB/s)** | **Time needed to write a full tape at maximum speed (hh:mm)**  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
**LTO-1** | 2000 | 100 GB | 200 GB | 20 | 40 | 1:23  
**LTO-2** | 2003 | 200 GB | 400 GB | 40 | 80 | 1:23  
**LTO-3** | 2005 | 400 GB | 800 GB | 80 | 160 | 1:23  
**LTO-4** | 2007 | 800 GB | 1.6 TB | 120 | 240 | 1:51  
**LTO-5** | 2010 | 1.5 TB | 3.0 TB | 140 | 280 | 3:10  
**LTO-6** | 2012 | 2.5 TB | 6.25 TB | 160 | 400 | 4:20  
**LTO-7** | 2015 | 6.0 TB | 15.0 TB  | 300 | 750 | 5:33  
**Type M (M8)** | 2017 | 9.0 TB  | 22.5 TB | 300 | 750 | 8:20  
**LTO-8** | 2017 | 12.0 TB | 30.0 TB | 360 | 900 | 9:16  
**LTO-9** | 2021 | 18.0 TB | 45.0 TB | 400 | 1,000 | 12:30  
**LTO-10** | TBA | 36.0 TB | 90.0 TB | 1,100 | 2,750 | 12:07  
**LTO-11** | TBA | 72.0 TB | 180.0 TB | TBA | TBA | TBA  
**LTO-12** | TBA | 144.0 TB | 360.0 TB | TBA | TBA | TBA  
**LTO-13** | TBA | 288.0 TB | 720.0 TB | TBA | TBA | TBA  
**LTO-14** | TBA | 576.0 TB | 1,440 TB | TBA | TBA | TBA  
_Note: “Type M (M8)” refers to how some_[ _LTO-8_](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/buy-it-equipment/buy-lto-8-data-tape-media/) _drives may write previously unused LTO-7 tapes with an increased, uncompressed capacity of 9 TB. Once this cartridge is initialized as Type M, it may not be changed back into a standard LTO-7 cartridge._
Unlike other storage tape technologies, a Ultrium cartridge can only be used by a particular generation of LTO drive (with the exception of Type M or M8, as discussed above,) with the following rules: 
  * Up to and including [LTO-7](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/buy-it-equipment/buy-lto-7-data-tape-media/), a Ultrium drive can _read_ data from a cartridge in the two prior generations (i.e., LTO-7 drives can read LTO-6 and LTO-5, but not LTO-4)
  * An Ultrium drive can write data to a cartridge in its own generation and from one prior generation (in the prior generation’s format.)


## How does an LTO tape work?
As a storage tape, an LTO tape reads and writes data in a sequential manner—one file after another—as opposed to hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs) that write and read data in a non-sequential way by using rotating disks.
This sequential storage method, however, means the system must start at the beginning of the tape and roll through it to read specific data or write new data. Naturally, this mechanism results in slower read/write speeds than HDDs or SSDs. However, today’s technologies—especially LTO’s advanced linear tape technology—offer similar drive performance to HDDs and SSDs.
Today, there are two primary tape technologies used in the market: linear tape (that is used by LTO) and helical scan.
A helical system writes data in diagonal strips along the tape. To achieve this, two tape reels with quarter-inch-wide tape media are used in the same cartridge. The helical scan technology offers a higher data storage density than linear tape but typically stores less overall data than linear tapes
The linear tape model, however, uses a much different method to read/write data, so these two formats are largely incompatible with each other despite offering comparable performances.
A linear tape (including LTO), on the other hand, has multiple read/write heads reading and writing data along parallel tracks of data that extend the length of the tape. Linear tape media is typically around a half-inch wide, and each tape cartridge only has one tape spool. 
### The physical structure of an LTO Tape
LTO tapes are made up of narrower servo bands and wider data bands. To be more exact, each tape has four data bands sandwiched between five servo bands. 
In such configurations, the servo bands act like guard rails for the read/write head or heads. The read/write head positions itself between two servo bands, ensuring compatibility and adjustments between different LTO tape drives. The magnetic servos will also play their parts in error correction and hardware data compression.
Each LTO tape head has either 8, 16, or 32 read/write head elements and 2 servo read elements. If it has 8 head elements, then it has 8 tracks, and the set of 8, 6, or 32 tracks are written or read in a one-way end-to-end pass. In this configuration, the tape head shifts laterally to access different tracks within each band and possibly to also access other bands. This set of tracks (8,16, or 32) is called a “wrap.”
[LTO-6](https://bigdatasupplyinc.com/buy-it-equipment/buy-lto-6-data-tape-media/) and newer tapes have 32 read/write head elements, and so can read or write 32 tracks simultaneously.
### How data is read and written to an LTO tape
Assuming it’s a completely blank, brand-new LTO tape, data writing starts at wrap 0, band 0. The wrap 0 runs from the beginning of the tape (BOT) to the end of the tape (EOT), so this is called a _forward_ wrap. The next sequential wrap (band 0, wrap 1) is a reverse wrap running from EOT to BOT while also including a track that runs along one side of the data band. 
This sequence continues in different wraps, alternating between forward and reverse passes with slight shifts toward the middle of the band on each pass. In such a pattern, the tracks written on each pass partially overlap the tracks written on the previous wrap in the same direction.
This back-and-forth alternating pattern runs from the edges of the tape into the middle and looks like a coiled snake, and thus is often known as _linear serpentine recording._ The linear serpentine procedure is repeated until all tracks and bands have been read or written as needed, and this method allows the tape to have more tracks than rear/write head elements, thus allowing for a substantially higher data storage capacity than the standard linear recording procedure.
### Speed matching/auto speed in LTO tapes
One of the drawbacks of storage tapes (including LTO Tapes) is the condition we call _shoe shining_. 
Tape drives spin rapidly, and when the drive finds the data it needs to access, the tape must physically stop and go back to the point where the data is, and this process can be repeated a few times (in a very fast manner) until the right location is met. This start, stop, and backup motion resembles the back-and-forth movement of shining a shoe (hence the name.)
Too many shoe-shining motions can wear out both the tape drive and the cartridge, shortening the life span of both. Also, repeated shoe-shining alone can slow the drive’s read/write time. 
To tackle this shoe-shining issue, newer LTO tapes adopt a built-in speed-matching (or auto speed) mechanism to lower the movement speed when needed and maintain a constant speed. In LTO-8 tapes, the auto (matched) speed ranges between 112 and 360 MB/s.
### Data security and integrity in LTO tapes
LTO offers several specific mechanisms in place to offer advanced levels of built-in security.
To date, LTO tapes offer a much lower level of bit-error-rate (BER) than HDDs and SSDs. LTO-7 and LTO-8 tapes offer a BER of 1 x 10-19. Meaning, a typical LTO-8 tape will have one bit error in over 10 exabytes of data, or 1 bit error in more than 800,000 LTO-8 tapes. In comparison, a typical HDD has a BER of HDDs (1 x 10-15).
To ensure that the data written on the tape is accurate and identical to what’s intended, an after-write verification process is used. This is mainly achieved by using the error-correcting code (ECC) on the headers, which is a mandatory part of the recording format on the tape.
## Why use LTO tapes over traditional hard drives
Magnetic tape has been used as a data storage solution for decades, dating back to the 1950s. Thus, it’s easy to overlook storage tapes, including LTO tapes, as old and obsolete. 
However, while LTO tapes may not offer the excitement of new SSD or cloud options, they do offer several unique benefits over other formats, especially as a long-term archiving medium. 
——————————————————————————————————————————
**Key benefit:**
While HDDs and SSDs offer higher read/write speeds than LTO tapes, LTO tapes offer a longer life span, a much lower error rate, and easier maintenance. This makes LTO tapes ideal for long-term archiving when the lower drive speeds won’t be much of an issue.
——————————————————————————————————————————-
Below are some key benefits offered by LTO tapes over other formats
**Long Lifespan**
LTO Tapes offer an unmatched shelf life of more than 30 years, making them an ideal choice for long-term archiving. Today’s technologies also ensure it’s easy to find files stored in LTO tapes years and even decades after they were archived.
In comparison, HDDs have a life expectancy of only 5 years on average, with a higher failure rate.
Keep in mind, however, that the 30-year lifespan prediction would require the LTO tape to be stored in an optimal and controlled environment with regulated temperature (18°C) and humidity (40%).
**Cost-effectiveness**
At the moment, magnetic tapes, including LTO tapes, offer the _lowest_ price per TB over other mediums.
However, when it comes to calculating storage costs, it’s important to consider various factors that would contribute to the total cost of ownership of the LTO tapes, including:
  * Storage tapes may cost _more_ in initial investment than an HDD or SSD since you’ll need to invest in the hardware (tape drive), storage media (tape), and software. However, the total cost per TB remains the lowest. 
  * You may need to invest in manpower to manage the tape libraries (which may not be cheap)
  * A key consideration is that you _don’t_ need to keep tapes powered up, unlike HDDs or SSDs, which will translate into a lower energy cost. However, since storage tapes need to be stored in a regulated environment, air conditioning and humidity control may add to the overall energy expenses.
  * In LTO storage tape systems, the drive and media are separated, so you don’t have to pay several times for DC motors and media controllers. You also don’t have to deal with frequent firmware updates.


Even after taking all these factors into account, including off-site storage cost, storage tapes remain the least expensive storage choice at the moment. This is because the cost per TB (or per GB) drops the more data you store on the LTO tape, which we will discuss below.
**Storage capacity**
Another key highlight of LTO storage tapes is their storage capacity, with the current LTO-8 offering 12 TB uncompressed/native capacity per cartridge.
With files (especially photos and videos) only getting larger and larger, the storage capacity of LTO tapes will become even more valuable.
**Read performance**
An advantage that’s often overlooked is the fact that LTO tapes’ read performance for large files is _better_ than HDDs. LTO-8 tapes offer around 360MB/s for uncompressed data reading, while traditional HDDs only offer 200 to 200 MB/s.
**Open standards**
LTO, as we know, stands for Linear Tape _Open_ , with Open here referring to ‘open standards.’
LTO’s open format is actually an advantage on its own. Since the technology is available for license by multiple vendors, the LTO format doesn’t hinge on the success or failure of one manufacturer alone, and the competition between these different manufacturers drives the price low (and quality in check.)
In short, the open format will keep LTO tapes competitively priced and constantly updated.
The LTO Consortium (IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Certance) has published a roadmap with predicted specifications for future generations of LTO tapes up to LTO-14, making obsolescence more manageable.
**Portability and security**
Another important advantage of the LTO storage tape, especially as a long-term archive medium, is its portability. It’s actually much safer to transport LTO tapes than HDDs with their vulnerable motorized parts. 
Also, since we can store tape cartridges 100% offline, they are safe from cyberattacks that rely on internet connectivity, as well as from accidental deletion, glitches, and other issues common in connected HDDs and SSDs. 
It’s also worth noting that it’s relatively easy to implement encryption on LTO tape cartridges. Since LTO-4, users can encrypt data before it is written to tape with Application Managed Encryption (AME). All current LTO manufacturers support AME.
## Some drawbacks of LTO tapes to consider
As we can see, there are many benefits of the LTO tape format (and storage tapes in general) over HDDs, SSDs, and other mediums. Yet, it doesn’t mean LTO is a perfect medium without any weaknesses at all. 
Here are some drawbacks to consider before investing in LTO tapes as your storage solutions: 
**Maintenance and management**
LTO tape drives must be stored in a room with controlled temperature and humidity, which may translate into additional costs and maintenance challenges. Also, LTO drives have mechanical parts that need to be cleaned and adjusted from time to time. 
Meaning, if you decide to invest in LTO tapes, make sure to plan regular maintenance periods to ensure their longevity. This will also translate into the need to invest inexperienced manpower with adequate technical knowledge.
You’ll need an experienced admin that can also help you in lifecycle management and decide when to upgrade and plan regular migrations. 
**Sequential read**
LTO tapes are sequential access media. Meaning, they must start at the beginning of the tape and roll through it to write new data or read specific data. This causes the LTO tapes to be slower than HDDs when it comes to reading data in random order, and when this happens frequently, it may cause wear out of both the tape cartridge and the drive.
However, speed is _not_ a deal breaker in LTO tapes, especially considering we’ll mainly use LTO for long-term archiving when speed isn’t too much of an issue. When storing larger files—including media files—, random-access speed is also less relevant. 
**Shoe-shining**
We have briefly discussed how excessive shoe-shining can shorten the lifespan of both the LTO drive and cartridge. While newer LTO tapes have built-in speed matching function to tackle this issue, this can still be a concern.
**Start-stop operation**
In LTO tapes, data to be stored is typically accumulated in buffers first before being streamed onto the tape. 
In such a configuration, when the buffer is not full, the tape may be stopped abruptly, positioning itself for the next delivery of data from the buffer. When this happens frequently, it can lower the LTO system’s overall speed.
**A single drive for multiple tapes**
Unlike HDDs or SSDs, when dealing with massive data catalogs, we have to eject and replace the LTO tape cartridges as needed. 
In practice, we will need to perform this manually (which can be challenging and time-consuming), or invest in a tape library, where a robot arm fetches and replaces the cartridges into the drives (which translates into additional costs.)
## How to ensure longevity of LTO tapes
While LTO tapes are naturally very durable, they do have mechanical moving parts that are subject to wear and tear and magnetic damage. 
Thus, it’s important to perform proper storage and maintenance to ensure longevity.
Here are some best practices to follow:
  * Keep them in a room that is cool and dry with controlled temperature (18°C) and humidity (40%). Avoid damp rooms and excessive exposure to heat and dust.
  * When storing LTO tapes, keep them in their cases as much as possible. Invest in good cases if you didn’t get them with the tapes.
  * Avoid loading tapes with physical issues into the tape drive since it may also cause problems to the drive. Carefully check if your tape has any physical damage—especially if the leader pin is in the right place—before loading it to the drive.
