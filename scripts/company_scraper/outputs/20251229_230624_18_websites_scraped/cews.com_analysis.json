Founded in 2016 and headquartered in Brea, California, the company operates with a mission to solve the growing e-waste problem through responsible, comprehensive recycling methods. CEWS maintains rigorous certifications including R2v3 and multiple ISO standards, ensuring environmentally sound practices and data security compliance. Their services are designed for businesses of all sizes, offering flexible, scalable solutions from one-time projects to ongoing enterprise programs.\n\nCEWS specializes in creating customized circular-economy strategies, processing over 200 truckloads of e-waste monthly and diverting millions of pounds from landfills annually. They operate multiple facilities across the U.S., including locations in California, Arizona, Kansas, and Mexico, totaling over 400,000 sq. ft. of processing space. A key differentiator is their 'Tech for Good' community initiative, which refurbishes donated laptops and provides them free to qualified individuals and families, bridging the digital divide and promoting education and job training. The company is committed to a strict Zero Landfill Policy and does not ship e-waste to third-world countries, focusing instead on sustainable recovery and reuse of valuable materials.",
