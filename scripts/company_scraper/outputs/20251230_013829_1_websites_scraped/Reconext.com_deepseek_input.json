Internal analysis showed manual operators were replacing up to 20% more cosmetic parts than specifications actually required because human judgment couldn’t consistently apply the standards.\nOptiline’s automated cosmetic grading eliminates that invisible overgrading, cutting unnecessary replacements and reclaiming lost yield.\nTalk to an expert\n##### The hidden cost of subjective grading\nManual grading inherently has a costly consistency problem. One operator flags a unit for rework. Another would’ve passed it. Decisions change from shift to shift, hour to hour.\nHere’s the best manual grading can realistically deliver:\n  * 75% max repeatability across operators\n  * Decisions that drift over time and location\n  * 20% more cosmetic replacements than specs require\n  * No visibility into how actual calls compare to intended standards\nOperators tend to over-apply cosmetic rules to be safe. But that safety buffer means tossing usable parts and bloating your cosmetic inventory.\nOptiLine fixes this. AI-powered defect detection evaluates actual device condition, compares it to what the spec says should pass, and calls it objectively every single time.\n##### Why AI grading outperforms manual inspection\n**Trained on 20,000+ samples that capture edge cases human training misses**\nBuilt using real-world annotated returns and synthetic defect images generated in NVIDIA Omniverse to catch defects operators consistently overlook.\n**Proprietary lighting reveals defects invisible to standard inspection**\nDirectional control and moving light wave techniques expose subtle blemishes that cause inconsistent human judgment calls.\n**Flexible grading logic eliminates operator drift**\nAdjust standards dynamically based on region, customer tier, or product lifecycle stage, delivering the same precision every time.\n**Automated work instruction cuts rework confusion**\nIntegrates with ERP to direct cosmetic operators: swap top cover only, leave rear intact, etc. No more guessing what needs replacement.\n##### Data Security and Traceability\n  * **Serial-level documentation** Every cosmetic decision recorded with retrievable images for complete audit trails.\n  * **Full traceability integration** ERP connectivity ensures automated workflows and real-time tracking.\n  * **Version-controlled standards** Grading specifications mapped to customer requirements with change management.\n  * **Analytics and optimization** Grafana dashboards enable QA teams to validate warranty claims and tune specs.\nSee Optiline for Yourself\n%\n### Grading Repeatability\nCompared to ~75% with manual inspection\n%\n### Increase in Yield Recovery\nBy eliminating subjective grading errors\n### Units Processed Daily\nAt high-volume global recovery facilities\n### Customers Re-calibrate Specs\nAfter seeing the gap between perceived vs actual standards\n%\n### Reduced Cosmetic Stock & Rework\nFewer unnecessary replacements, leaner operations\n###  How Optiline  Eliminates  Grading Guesswork\n### Clean\n#### 01\nProducts are surface-cleaned manually or via automated wash before inspection.\n### Grade\n#### 02\nRobotic loading ensures precise positioning. 8 HD cameras with proprietary lighting capture defects human eyes miss. AI compares findings to your exact specification without subjective interpretation.\n### Route\n#### 03\nPassed units continue directly to functional testing. Failed units route to rework with exact component-level replacement instructions.\n### Track\n#### 04\nEvery decision recorded at serial level with retrievable images. Data flows to Reconext ERP for automated workflows and yield analysis via Grafana dashboards.\n###  Common Deployment  Questions\n##### Why does OptiLine require controlled environments?\nConsistent grading demands calibrated lighting, precise camera alignment, and maintained hardware. Controlled facilities eliminate the environmental variables that cause grading drift in distributed setups.\n##### Can grading specs be tuned to different markets or ages?\nYes. Standards can be dynamically adjusted based on region, customer tier, or product maturity.\n##### How are cosmetic operators guided?\nERP receives test results and flags which components require replacement based on zone- and defect-level analysis.\n##### What products is OptiLine compatible with?\nCurrently used for CPE, laptops, VR/AR headsets, and gaming consoles. Additional device classes under development.\n##### How long does it take to integrate a new product into OptiLine?\nApproximately 20 working days including spec mapping, AI training, validation, and SOP updates.\n##  Built to Work With\n###  Ready to stop wasting time and money?
