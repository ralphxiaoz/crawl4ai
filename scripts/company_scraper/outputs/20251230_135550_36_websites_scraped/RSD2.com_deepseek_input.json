The crawl covers multiple pages (Home, About, Contact, etc.).\n2. There is significant overlapping/duplicate information across these pages.\n3. You MUST consolidate all information into a SINGLE company profile.\n4. Do NOT output a list of companies. Extract exactly ONE company object.\n5. Ignore minor differences in descriptions across pages; synthesize them into a comprehensive summary.\n\n## INFORMATION TO EXTRACT\n\n1. **Company Information:**\n   - Company name\n   - Main website URL (the root domain, e.g., https://example.com)\n   - Main business/industry\n   - Brief description of what they do\n\n2. **Products/Services:**\n   - List all products or services offered\n   - Key capabilities or specializations\n\n3. **Contact Information:**\n   - ALL email addresses found (support, sales, info, contact, etc.)\n   - Phone numbers\n   - Physical address/location\n   - Contact page URLs\n\n4. **Additional Details:**\n   - Company size (if mentioned)\n   - Year founded (if mentioned)\n   - Certifications or awards (especially R2v3, e-Stewards)\n   - Geographic coverage/service areas\n\n## VENDOR QUALIFICATION CRITERIA\n\nEvaluate if this company is a good fit for Yilong based on these 2 pillars:\n\n### PILLAR 1: INVENTORY FIT\n**Must Have:**\n- Enterprise IT assets: Laptops, Desktops, Data Center Servers, Networking Equipment, Storage\n\n**Bonus Points:**\n- Harvested components (high-value CPU, RAM, SSD/HDD)\n\n**Condition Requirements:**\n- Grade A/B (Ready for Retail) - Preferred\n- Tested Functional Grade C (Ready for Refurbishment) - Acceptable\n\n**RED FLAGS:**\n- Only handles residential recycling (curbside pickup)\n- Focuses primarily on shredding/scrap metal\n- No mention of testing or grading\n- Only handles consumer electronics (phones, tablets, TVs)\n\n### PILLAR 2: OPERATIONAL FIT\n**Business Type:**\n- Must be an ITAD Processor or Asset Recovery Firm (B2B focus)\n- NOT a retail reseller or consumer-focused recycler\n\n**Certification:**\n- R2v3 certification is highly preferred (indicates they can test/wipe data correctly)\n- e-Stewards is also acceptable\n\n**Sales Channel:**\n- Must support Wholesale / Bulk sales (Pallet/Truckload quantities)\n- If they only sell single units on eBay/Amazon to consumers, they are a BAD fit\n\n**RED FLAGS:**\n- Only residential/consumer services\n- No B2B capabilities mentioned\n- No certifications\n- Only retail sales channels\n\n## EVALUATION OUTPUT\nBased on the above criteria, provide:\n- is_good_fit: true/false - Is this company worth reaching out to?\n- inventory_fit_assessment: Detailed explanation of how they match our inventory needs\n- operational_fit_assessment: Detailed explanation of their operational capabilities\n- red_flags: List of any concerns or disqualifying factors\n- recommendation: \"Reach out\", \"Skip\", or \"Research further\"\n- reasoning: Clear explanation of why you recommend reaching out or skipping\n\nBe thorough and extract ALL contact emails you can find.\nIf information is not available, use null for that field.\n",
