High-tech devices usually contain rechargeable lithium-ion batteries because it is much more convenient to charge a device than it is to frequently dismantle it and replace a standard alkaline disposable battery (commonly used in basic devices like tv remotes or flashlights). Lithium-ion batteries last much longer and have higher power density than traditional batteries.\n### What’s in a Lithium Battery?\nLithium batteries are composed of various elements, including lithium-ion or lithium-polymer cells, a protective casing, electrolytes, and valuable metals like cobalt, nickel, and copper. Despite being rechargeable, they will eventually require replacement due to a loss of capacity. You should NOT dispose of them in regular trash or recycling bins, because they contain harmful substances that could be hazardous to the environment if released.\n### Types of Lithium Batteries\nThere are several different types of lithium batteries, each with its own unique composition and applications.\n**Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LiCoO2 or LCO)**\nThis is the most common type of lithium-ion battery and is used in many consumer electronics like laptops, smartphones, and digital cameras. They offer high energy density, providing long-lasting power.\n**Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4 or LFP)**\nThese batteries are known for their excellent thermal stability and safety characteristics, which is why they are used in devices like electric vehicles, electric bikes, and storage systems for renewable energy. LiFePO4 batteries have a longer cycle life and can withstand high charge and discharge rates.\n**Lithium Manganese Oxide (LiMn2O4 or LMO)**\nLMO batteries are commonly found in power tools, medical devices, and electric bikes. They can deliver high currents and have a relatively long cycle life.\n**Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (LiNiMnCoO2 or NMC)**\nNMC batteries are a popular choice for electric vehicles and energy storage applications. They offer a good balance between high energy density and power output.\n**Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminum Oxide (LiNiCoAlO2 or NCA)**\nNCA batteries are also used in electric vehicles, and have similar advantages to NMC batteries.\n**Lithium Titanate (Li4Ti5O12 or LTO)**\nLTO batteries are known for their extremely fast charge and discharge rates, which makes them helpful for quick-charging electric buses and energy storage systems. They have a long cycle life and great thermal stability.\n### Why is it Important to Recycle Lithium Batteries?\nRecycling is critical for conservation of natural resources, minimizing waste, and preventing pollution. By reusing materials from recycled products like valuable metals and minerals, we reduce the need for extracting and processing virgin resources from the earth. This helps conserve natural habitats and minimizes the impact of resource extraction on ecosystems. Recycling lithium batteries also diverts waste from landfills, reducing the rapidly growing need for new landfill sites and keeping harmful substances from entering the environment.\n### How Does It Work?\nThe process of recycling lithium batteries involves several steps to carefully ensure the proper recovery of materials. First, batteries must be separated from regular waste streams. After collection, batteries are sorted based on their types to facilitate efficient processing. The batteries are then dismantled to access the cells inside. Battery cells are the basic building block of a battery that generates electrical energy through chemical reactions. Shredding, sieving, and magnetic separation is then done to sort metallic components from the battery cells. These components undergo further processing to extract valuable metals. Remaining components, including plastics, are then disposed of responsibly.\n### Dangers of Improper Lithium Battery Disposal\nLithium batteries contain a sheet that separates electrodes and prevents short-circuiting. If a battery is crushed or punctured in any way, the separator could be breached causing a thermal reaction – leading to a spark or fire. If the compromised battery is near any flammable material or there are a bunch of batteries together (say in a landfill or a recycling center) it could be a recipe for disaster. In recent years, there have been many lithium ion battery fires due to malfunction or improper handling.\nLithium is highly reactive: temperature, charging voltage, and casing damage can cause a thermal reaction. That’s why airline passengers are recommended to keep laptops and cell phones in their carry-on bags, and prohibited from checking spare lithium batteries and e-cigarettes in luggage%20lithium%20metal%20batteries,passenger%20in%20carry%2Don%20baggage.). Proper handling is ALWAYS required to prevent fire and pollution risk while recycling lithium batteries.\n### Electronics Recycling at METech\nWe offer end-to-end IT Asset Disposition and Data Security services for government, healthcare, and technology clients across the United States.

By storing excess generation for use at peak demand, BESS technology increases system resilience, improves grid stability, and maximizes solar ROI.\nBut just like PV panels and inverters, a BESS eventually reaches the end of its usable life. Whether due to capacity degradation, safety concerns, or system upgrades, **proper end-of-life planning is crucial for solar developers, EPCs, asset owners, and O &M teams.**\nMETech Recycling specializes in safe, compliant, and sustainable BESS decommissioning for solar sites of any scale.\n## **1. Why BESS End-of-Life Planning Matters for Solar Projects**\nA BESS is composed of battery modules, inverters, thermal management systems, wiring, and enclosures—all of which require careful handling at end-of-life.\nFor solar operators, failure to plan ahead can lead to:\n  * **Safety risks** from high-voltage lithium-ion components\n  * **Fire hazards** associated with thermal runaway\n  * **Regulatory non-compliance** during hazardous-material transport\n  * **Environmental impact** from improper disposal of lithium, cobalt, and nickel\n  * **Lost revenue** by overlooking second-life or material recovery opportunities\nIntegrating BESS decommissioning into the solar lifecycle protects your project, your personnel, and your investment.\n## **2. The BESS Decommissioning Process for Solar Sites**\nMETech simplifies the technical, regulatory, and logistical challenges involved in retiring energy storage systems from solar farms.\n### **a. Planning & Risk Assessment**\n  * Document system capacity (MW/MWh), site layout, and component details\n  * Create a solar-specific Decommissioning Plan\n  * Conduct hazard assessments\n  * Ensure compliance with EPA, DOT, and local AHJ rules\n  * Prepare chain-of-custody documentation\n### **b. De-Energize & Disconnect**\n  * Safely discharge and electrically isolate all battery units\n  * Disconnect DC-coupled or AC-coupled solar tie-ins\n  * Follow strict LOTO (lock-out/tag-out) procedures\n### **c. Removal & Transport**\n  * Dismantle racks, containers, and wiring\n  * Package lithium batteries to Class 9 hazmat standards\n  * Coordinate nationwide transport to METech’s R2v3-certified facilities\n### **d. Second-Life Evaluation & Recycling**\n  * Test modules for remaining capacity (possible use: microgrids, backup storage)\n  * Recycle non-viable modules to recover lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper\n  * Process auxiliary solar equipment such as inverters, transformers, and BOS gear\n### **e. Site Restoration**\n  * Remove remaining structures and storage enclosures\n  * Clear concrete or metal foundations as required\n  * Provide full reporting for environmental and ESG documentation\n## **3. Second Life vs. Recycling for Solar BESS**\n### **Second Life Applications**\nBattery modules with usable capacity can be repurposed into:\n  * Backup systems for ag facilities\n  * Community microgrids\n  * Off-grid storage for low-demand sites\nThis supports both sustainability and cost efficiency in the solar ecosystem.\n### **Responsible Recycling**\nWhen reuse isn’t viable, METech ensures:\n  * Full recovery of metals (lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper)\n  * Proper processing of plastics, wiring, and metals\n  * Zero landfill for hazardous components\nOur R2v3-certified processes ensure all materials are handled safely and responsibly.\n## **4.

The company was founded to recycle precious metal scrap then evolved to recycle electronic components and manufacturing by-products. Over the years, end-of-life electronic equipment, brand, proprietary design, HIPAA and all government compliance protection, secure data destruction and asset management have become the core focus as the business landscape continues to change.\n### Metech History Timeline\n**1875**\nThe Wildberg Brothers facility, (aka Boliden Metech) was a metal reclamation plant which operated in San Francisco between 1907 and 1986. The site was approximately 5 1/2 acres in size. This facility was used as an antimony smelting plant which operated for an unknown duration beginning in 1875.\n**1907**\nThe Site was purchased in 1907 by the Wildberg Brothers Company who operated a metal reclamation facility. The operations included milling, sampling, assaying of scrap materials, electrolytic deposition of silver, stripping of gold, and copper concentration. Gold, platinum, palladium, silver and copper were recovered as finished products.\n**1968**\nRMI traces its origin back to 1968 in Woonsocket, R.I. At that time, Refinemet focused on precious metals and tantalum recovery. Refinemet expanded into electronics recycling by “default” in the late ’70s and early ’80s because customers like AT&T, Burroughs, DEC and IBM had large pieces of equipment that they were retiring.\n**1980**\nWildberg Brothers sold the facility to Refinemet International (RMI) in 1980. RMI primarily used the facility for precious metal scrap processing and refining.\n**1983**\nIn 1983, shortly after expanding into processing end-of-life electronics, Boliden, a smelting and mining company based in Stockholm, Sweden, purchased RMI and renamed it Boliden Metech. It was during this time that Metech moved the East Coast operation from Woonsocket, RI to Mapleville, RI.\nBoliden used the San Francisco facility primarily for precious metal scrap processing but did not engage in refining operations at the Site. Operations conducted onsite consisted of material sorting, sampling, and assaying before the materials were containerized for shipment to Boliden facilities overseas for processing.\n**1986**\nBoliden discontinued all operations at the San Francisco site in May 1986. All buildings at the site, with the exception of Building 1, the Office Building, Building 2, the Laboratory; and Buildings 11-12, the Melt Shop, and Mechanical Processing area, were demolished and the business was moved to our current location in Gilroy, CA. Trelleborg, (the parent company of Boliden), later spun off the smelting operations under the name Boliden but retained Metech as a recycling and processing operation.\nIn 2002 Viking Investment and Asset Management, based in Johannesburg, South Africa, bought Metech.\n**2005**\nIn 2005 Metech was acquired by MTI Corp and relocated the corporate offices from Mapleville, RI to Worcester, Mass. The company designed a processing line to include shredders and downstream separation equipment.\nAt this time, Metech also discontinued receiving precious-metals-containing hazardous waste and scaled back its other local precious metals refining businesses that were not adding value to the company’s focus on integrated electronics recycling.\n**2007**\nIn 2007 Metech was acquired by “Centillion Environment and Recycling Ltd” of Singapore.\nIn 2008 Centillion purchases “Guaranteed Recycling Xperts” (GRX) with locations in Denver, CO, Salt Lake City, UT and Omaha, NE.\n**2009**\n2009 Centillion merges Metech and GRX under the Metech Recycling banner.\nIn 2012 Centillion was renamed Metech International\n**2016**\nIn 2016 the Worcester facility was relocated once more to its current location in nearby Clinton, MA. At this time, corporate operations were permanently transferred to the Gilroy, CA facility.\n**2018**\nIn 2018 Metech Recycling was purchased by First America Metals Group and taken Private.\n**2021**\nMETech continues operating today with a strong national footprint serving industries such as medical, military, government, education, manufacturing and more.
