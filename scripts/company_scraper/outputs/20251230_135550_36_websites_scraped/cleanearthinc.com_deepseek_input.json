  "system_prompt": "## YOUR ROLE\nYou are a Senior Procurement Consultant for Yilong Business Limited, a high-volume IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) trading firm.\nYour goal is to evaluate potential US-based vendors to see if they fit our supply chain requirements.\n\n## CONTEXT - WHO WE ARE (THE BUYER)\n- Company: Yilong Business Limited (Hong Kong-based with US operations)\n- Business Model: We purchase used IT assets in bulk (Ex Works - EXW) from US facilities and export them to established downstream markets in Hong Kong, Mainland China, and Southeast Asia\n- Volume: We have a purchasing budget of ~$1.5M per month ($10M–$20M annually)\n- Compliance: We operate a strict \"High-Quality Refurbishment\" model. We do NOT export e-waste. We require assets to be \"Tested Functional\" (R2v3 F2/C3 or better)\n\n## YOUR TASK\nYou are analyzing a company website. The provided content belongs to ONE SINGLE company.\nAll URLs are under the same root domain.\nThe content contains text from multiple pages, separated by \"# URL: \".\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. The crawl covers multiple pages (Home, About, Contact, etc.).\n2. There is significant overlapping/duplicate information across these pages.\n3. You MUST consolidate all information into a SINGLE company profile.\n4. Do NOT output a list of companies. Extract exactly ONE company object.\n5. Ignore minor differences in descriptions across pages; synthesize them into a comprehensive summary.\n\n## INFORMATION TO EXTRACT\n\n1. **Company Information:**\n   - Company name\n   - Main website URL (the root domain, e.g., https://example.com)\n   - Main business/industry\n   - Brief description of what they do\n\n2. **Products/Services:**\n   - List all products or services offered\n   - Key capabilities or specializations\n\n3. **Contact Information:**\n   - ALL email addresses found (support, sales, info, contact, etc.)\n   - Phone numbers\n   - Physical address/location\n   - Contact page URLs\n\n4. **Additional Details:**\n   - Company size (if mentioned)\n   - Year founded (if mentioned)\n   - Certifications or awards (especially R2v3, e-Stewards)\n   - Geographic coverage/service areas\n\n## VENDOR QUALIFICATION CRITERIA\n\nEvaluate if this company is a good fit for Yilong based on these 2 pillars:\n\n### PILLAR 1: INVENTORY FIT\n**Must Have:**\n- Enterprise IT assets: Laptops, Desktops, Data Center Servers, Networking Equipment, Storage\n\n**Bonus Points:**\n- Harvested components (high-value CPU, RAM, SSD/HDD)\n\n**Condition Requirements:**\n- Grade A/B (Ready for Retail) - Preferred\n- Tested Functional Grade C (Ready for Refurbishment) - Acceptable\n\n**RED FLAGS:**\n- Only handles residential recycling (curbside pickup)\n- Focuses primarily on shredding/scrap metal\n- No mention of testing or grading\n- Only handles consumer electronics (phones, tablets, TVs)\n\n### PILLAR 2: OPERATIONAL FIT\n**Business Type:**\n- Must be an ITAD Processor or Asset Recovery Firm (B2B focus)\n- NOT a retail reseller or consumer-focused recycler\n\n**Certification:**\n- R2v3 certification is highly preferred (indicates they can test/wipe data correctly)\n- e-Stewards is also acceptable\n\n**Sales Channel:**\n- Must support Wholesale / Bulk sales (Pallet/Truckload quantities)\n- If they only sell single units on eBay/Amazon to consumers, they are a BAD fit\n\n**RED FLAGS:**\n- Only residential/consumer services\n- No B2B capabilities mentioned\n- No certifications\n- Only retail sales channels\n\n## EVALUATION OUTPUT\nBased on the above criteria, provide:\n- is_good_fit: true/false - Is this company worth reaching out to?\n- inventory_fit_assessment: Detailed explanation of how they match our inventory needs\n- operational_fit_assessment: Detailed explanation of their operational capabilities\n- red_flags: List of any concerns or disqualifying factors\n- recommendation: \"Reach out\", \"Skip\", or \"Research further\"\n- reasoning: Clear explanation of why you recommend reaching out or skipping\n\nBe thorough and extract ALL contact emails you can find.\nIf information is not available, use null for that field.\n",

Our portfolio of soil remediation technologies, services, and expertise, strategically aligns with today’s needs for sustainable solutions. We are a dedicated team that holds the highest standards for regulatory compliance, our customers, and sustainable solutions.\n  * #### How We Do it\nOur wide variety of soil remediation treatment, disposal and recycling options allows us to individually address each type of contamination found on-site and send it to the proper treatment facility with budget and time in mind.\n  * #### Our Technologies\nThermal Desorption\nBioremediation\nChemical Fixation\nPhysical Treatment\nMobile Solutions\n## Materials Handled\n Soil Contamination\n Construction Debris Disposal\n Dredged Material\n Hazardous & Non-Hazardous Waste\n Coal Combustion Products\nAn in-depth look\nOur capabilities\nChemical fixation\nThermal Desorption\nBioremediation\nPhysical treatment\nChemical fixation Thermal Desorption  Bioremediation  Physical treatment\nChemical fixation is a soil remediation process used to treat hydrocarbon contaminated soil and/or metal contaminated soil. This process involves stabilizing contaminated material by mixing it with other earthen material, and then treating the blended material with certain chemical additives to formulate a particular material. This treatment binds the petroleum contaminants and prevents leaching. Chemcial fixation is best used for light to medium hydrocarbon contamination and/or contaminated soil impacted by metals.\n  * Thermal desorption is an environmental remediation technology that is used to treat material with a broad range of hydrocarbon contamination. This process involves heating soil in a rotating dryer to remove or separate the contaminants from the soil. This process is often referred to as “low temp” thermal desorption to differentiate it from high temperature incineration. This method is primarily used to treat soil with high levels of contaminants, such as MGP soil, by heating it in a rotating dryer to destroy contaminants. Thermal treatment can be conducted at fixed facilities or at a Remediation Site with a portable unit. For large quantities, typically over 30,000 tons, onsite thermal treatment may be the most cost-effective solution.\nSeveral factors need to be evaluated to determine what type and size thermal treatment unit is ideal for each project including the property layout and location, available utilities, quantity of material to be treated, material characteristics and timeframe for treatment. Pricing is an important consideration in the decision-making process for an onsite thermal unit when determining if onsite thermal treatment is a viable option.\n  * Bioremediation is a treatment process that provides a cost effective and environmentally conscious recycling solution for non-hazardous contaminated soils. Through a process called bioaugmentation, microorganisms are introduced into the contaminated environment as a granular product, with a proper nutrient mix to stimulate and foster their growth while breaking down the contaminants in the soil.\nThe process degrades organic contaminants, such as petroleum hydrocarbons, in the soil by the application of cultured microorganisms selected for their ability to metabolize the petroleum products.\nSoil that is lightly contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons is inoculated with engineered bacteria and nutrients that combine to completely break down soil contaminants in 7 to 14 days. Bioremediation is typically used on soil with lower levels of contaminants. The resulting treated soil is recycled as fill material or landfill capping or cover.\nPhysical treatment of soil includes special sizing and segregation processes to remove unsuitable materials from incoming soils. The resulting soils generate an engineered material suitable for beneficial reuse as fill material or landfill capping or cover.\nNext Step\n### Trusted in all sectors\n# URL: https://www.cleanearthinc.com/services/dea-pharmaceutical-waste\n## Utility\n## CTA\n# DEA & Pharmaceutical waste\n## Hazardous & Non-hazardous waste services\nEach Clean Earth technician brings the highest level of service, professionalism, expertise, and efficiency to each and every on-site visit.\n## How Clean Earth helps\n### Safe and compliant disposal of pharmaceutical waste\nPharmaceutical waste disposal and management affects more than just the bottom line—it also has real implications for the environment, consumers and employees. With increasing oversight from regulatory agencies, every facility that disposes of pharmaceuticals, from controlled substances to OTC medication, must meet strict handling and disposal mandates. Beyond harsh financial penalties, failure to meet these requirements can result in violations that have a lasting impact on brand perception. Clean Earth's expertise assists customers – from a single retail pharmacy to a large medical complex— with the safe and compliant disposal of pharmaceutical waste.\n## Materials Handled\n Hazardous & Non-Hazardous Waste\n Pharmaceutical Waste\n Aerosols\n Electronic Waste\n Universal Waste\n## About our service\n### DEA waste management\nControlled substances are closely regulated by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which monitors manufacturers, distributors and providers to prevent the diversion of potentially dangerous or illegal substances. The DEA also has the authority to deliver harsh penalties to any noncompliant facility. Compliance with evolving pharmaceutical waste disposal regulations requires constant diligence throughout the entire process and meticulous documentation for accurate reporting. Clean Earth's comprehensive controlled substance management program provides robust DEA waste management solutions to help avoid and minimize these costly violations.To avoid fines and violations, waste from any location must be properly documented, segregated and destroyed, with every step from identification through disposal accurately recorded and reported to all relevant regulatory bodies. Full compliance demands that this process is regularly monitored and audited to avoid any costly oversights.\nAs a DEA registrant, our pharmaceutical waste disposal services are authorized to manage the destruction and disposal of controlled substances (C-II through C-V). To accomplish this, we utilize a network of Clean Earth-owned, DEA-permitted Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs). A proprietary web-based reporting tool and technicians’ electronic scales, mobile printers and laptops ensure that every step of the process is thoroughly documented and recorded in accordance with regulatory requirements. This DEA waste management approach includes regular consultations, employee compliance monitoring, delivery of appropriate waste management supplies and separation and segregation of waste for transportation. This expertly managed process helps customers avoid or minimize any regulatory penalties while protecting their brands and consumers at the same time.\n## We are here to help you\n### we help manage the complex and changing regulatory requirements of pharmaceutical waste disposal\nAbout our service\nMedical facility services\nRegulatory requirements guidance\nPharmaceutical waste characterization\nRe-characterization EPA's Final Rule\nRegulatory requirements guidance Pharmaceutical waste characterization Re-characterization EPA's Final Rule\nBusinesses that need to dispose of over-the-counter medications face extensive penalties for violating any one of numerous regulations, regardless of waste quantity. Clean Earth helps customers manage the complex and changing regulatory requirements of pharmaceutical waste disposal, which includes disposal of over-the-counter medications. Whether customized for a single facility or for thousands of nationwide locations, these pharmaceutical waste services offer fine-tuned solutions for accountable, standardized and compliant disposal.\nClean Earth's regulatory and reverse-logistics experts collaborate with pharmacies and manufacturers to ensure compliance with all state and federal regulations, including those enforced by the following agencies:\nDrug Enforcement Administration (DEA)\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\nConsumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nGiven that their waste profiles include a wide array of chemicals, solvents and other hazardous and nonhazardous waste in addition to pharmaceuticals, it is critical that pharmaceutical manufacturers engage vendors with the expertise to properly manage all waste streams. Proper characterization is vital to the successful management of any waste, but it is a particularly important aspect of managing the hazardous waste materials generated by pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. Clean Earth's waste characterization expertise helps manufacturers minimize their risk of violations and penalties by properly identifying and separating DEA hazardous and nonhazardous material, including byproducts, chemicals, solvents, R&D wastes, waste water and excess inventory. The process begins with an initial waste characterization to determine the appropriate designation for all wastes, leveraging the tools and experience gained from processing countless pharmaceutical returns and recalls. Clean Earth's proprietary database profiles more than 450,000 National Drug Code (NDC) numbers, and waste characterization includes a review of substances identified by:\nEPA (40 CFR §262.11 and 261.3)\nDOT (49 CFR § 173)\nNational Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)\nState Regulations\nTo protect customers’ employees, reputations and local communities, periodic re-characterization of wastes and frequent audits of all Treatment Storage and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs) are required. Characterization results in a waste profile, which is a description of all the chemical constituents and generating process for a hazardous or nonhazardous waste. Finally, technicians print signature-ready waste manifests (tracking and shipping records) and coordinate all waste transportation logistics, allowing customers to focus on their business instead of regulatory requirements.\nNext Step\n### Trusted in all sectors\n# URL: https://www.cleanearthinc.com/services/dredge\n## Utility\n## CTA\n# Handling your dredged materials in a way that benefits everyone.\n## Dredge\nWith a longstanding legacy of environmental responsibility and stewardship, we take an efficient approach that benefits your business and the world around us.\n Get a quote\n## About our services\n### Together we build a sustainable future\nAs one of the nation's longest-running processors of dredged materials, we are dedicated to providing beneficial reuse solutions for material that threatens our nation's waterways.

The customer will also receive an Action Report with details, pictures, a call log and supporting documentation.\n  * Container leaks\nThe two most important steps in any container leak response are identifying the spilled material and securing the container for cleaning. For compliance and safety, the entire process must be monitored to ensure timely and accurate communication, proper documentation and appropriate procedures. After identifying the leaking material and assessing any immediate threats to human health and the environment, expert technicians will secure both the container and the surrounding area while also ensuring that no additional material is allowed to escape. The container may also be moved to a secure area, with special attention paid to weather and wind direction to maximize safety. Technicians may also perform air monitoring to check oxygen levels. Cleaning will then be performed using specialized equipment, which may include HEPA-filter vacuums, salvage drums and disposable cleaning products. Technicians will separate damaged or contaminated items from any items deemed safe. Upon completion, the Response Manager will take post-event photos and walk any required customer representatives through the area to confirm completion and satisfaction. The customer will also receive a detailed Action Report that includes images, a call log and supporting documentation.\nUnknown substance handling\nSubstance identification is one of the most important responsibilities entrusted to our highly trained Incident Managers, who are on call for any emergency response. In the event that a customer discovers or spills an unknown substance, Incident Managers are trained to not only identify numerous chemicals and compounds, but also to assess any potential danger. The Incident Manager will identify the unknown substance as quickly and accurately as possible, then provide the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for the substance. The SDS is then used to inform the on-site technicians of proper handling procedures, physical data, potential health hazards and equipment requirements for storage and disposal. When a customer is confronted with an unknown substance, Clean Earth's swift response, deep knowledge and specialized tools help resolve the situation safely and compliantly.\n  * Chemical & laboratory spills\nA chemical or laboratory spill presents many risks, from potential health and safety hazards to the possibility of damaging regulatory violations and fines. To ensure safety and compliance, highly-trained professionals must oversee the entire containment and cleaning process, focusing on consistent and accurate communication, proper documentation and clear procedures. After identifying the spilled chemical and assessing any immediate health threats, expert technicians will secure the surrounding area and contain the spill. If necessary, the container may be moved to a secure area, with special attention paid to weather conditions and wind direction to maximize safety. Technicians may also perform air monitoring to check oxygen levels. Cleaning will then be performed using specialized equipment, which may include HEPA-filter vacuums, salvage drums and disposable cleaning products. Technicians will also separate damaged or contaminated items from any items deemed safe. Upon completion, the Response Manager will take post-event photos and walk any required customer representatives through the area to confirm completion and satisfaction. The customer will also receive an Action Report with details, pictures, a call log and supporting documentation.\nNatural disaster response\nIn addition to destruction and financial devastation, natural disasters can present communities with significant health, safety and environmental risks, often in the form of hazardous spills and leaks. To reduce the risks of injury, environmental harm or regulatory penalties, a successful disaster response requires extensive expertise and knowledge of hazardous materials and waste management, including applicable procedures and regulations. Often, natural disaster response also requires emergency spill response for fuel spills, chemical spills, DOT hazardous materials spills and EPA hazardous waste spills, as well as critical tasks such as identification of unknown substances, spill containment, proper waste handling and clean-up. The Clean Earth team has responded to thousands of environmental emergency calls, providing disaster recovery assistance after hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and other natural disasters.\nNext Step\n### Trusted in all sectors\nPharmaceuticals\n###  Pharmaceuticals\nIn need of emergency response?\nFill out the form or call us at our dedicated emergency response line: 877.577.2669\n# URL: https://www.cleanearthinc.com/services/environmental-support\n## Utility\n## CTA\n# Environmental support\n## Soil services\nAssuring every possible ton of contaminated soil that can be recycled, is recycled.\n## How Clean Earth helps\n### Supporting your soil remediation project and\nFor our soil recycling projects, Clean Earth characterizes the contaminated soil from a project site to determine the volume that could potentially be recycled through our network of treatment and recycling facilities. This upfront waste characterization process presents a multitude of benefits. First and foremost - the environmental benefit. Through proper waste classification conducted by a team of environmental experts, Clean Earth finds more soil that can be recycled versus the often taken easy road of disposing directly into a landfill. Second, this characterization process can at times provide cost savings to the customer. Clean Earth has numerous treatment locations available to service a single project, providing a full-service solution for projects that have various contaminants.\n## Materials Handled\n Soil Contamination\n Construction Debris Disposal\n Coal Combustion Products\n Dredged Material\n Hazardous & Non-Hazardous Waste\nAbout our service\nOur capabilities\nSampling assistance\nWaste classification guidance\nApproval package preparation & reviews\nExcavation, material, disposal plan\nSampling assistance Waste classification guidance Approval package preparation & reviews  Excavation, material, disposal plan\nSampling assistance\nOur environmental expertise provided on projects into Clean Earth facilities could make a positive and significant impact on your soil remediation project and your company's sustainablity efforts.\nDevelop project site map with sample locations to ensure samples are representative of the project site in its entirety.\nSampling descriptions and methodology guidance.\nFacility QA/QC sample collections from received material to verify the profile.\nProvide overall sampling oversight and guidance, eliminating frustration of problematic waste streams.\nFirsthand view of the subsurface conditions.\nWaste classification guidance\nProvide guidance and scope for waste classification sampling; eliminates the guesswork on the waste classification sampling requirements and mitigates having soils managed improperly.\nProvide summary tables for waste classification and approvals.\nCompare data to facility permits and BU acceptance criteria.\nReview of facility permits to identify the specific types of wastes the facility can accept, note any outbound restrictions; assists in cross approval sampling.\nDesignate material to the appropriate facility based on acceptability and economics.\nAccount for and coordinate generator preferences on backend outlets and required certifications of disposal, recycling, or destruction.\nApproval package preparation & reviews\nProvide guidance for required approval and compliance reviews and develop the approval packages for all materials.\nReview profiles for accuracy and completeness.\nIssue approval letter for specific analytical data sets.\nSubmit packages to 3rd party engineers or regulatory agencies for approval.\n  * The Excavation, Material, Disposal Plan (EMDP) sets the foundation for a project’s waste remediation plan. It addresses the management of all identified waste streams, from sampling through waste disposal records. The EMDP allows our customers to have a clear understanding of all the moving parts and details of their specific remediation project.\nThis environmental support is provided on projects for small to mid-size contractors and/or general contractors who are not equipped to handle such services internally or do not have an in-house environmental division.\nThe following support can be provided under the EMDP preparation:\nSoil Testing, Sampling, Gridding\nData Review & Evaluations\nWaste Characterization\nReport Preparation\nFacility Approvals\nTransportation Plan\nOn-Site Field Services Plan\nCertifications\nNext Step\n## About our service\n### Map & grid delineation, Your On-Site Management Tool\nOnce project samples have been collected, and the analytical has been reviewed, our environmental team will develop a delineated map and grid approval document for your entire project site.\nThe site is broken down into grids, each of which is cross-referenced for eligibility into our multiple fixed-base facilities and/or beneficial use sites. Those results are then analyzed to consider time, cost, and location, ultimately giving our customer the best disposal location for each grid.\nWe recognize the importance of being environmentally responsible. Clean Earth facilities identified on the delineation map are also closest and most convenient to the project site which ultimately lowers our carbon footprint in transportation.\nConsider this as your personal on-site management tool.\n### Benefits of a map & grid\n  * Provides the maximum number of outlets per grid to determine the most cost effective solutions.\n  * Ability to provide and maintain a master facility approval list that allows the customer and their team to identify all the available treatment, recycling, or disposal options available to them for every grid at the project site.\n  * Establishes horizontal and vertical delineation, providing cross approval into various facilities.\n  * Isolates contamination that is is a key factor to saving money.\n  * For all cross approvals, horizontally separated delineations can be completed and the material can be stockpiled for sampling.\n  * Stockpiles are retested at the facility.\n  * Minimizes the volume required for hazardous treatment in turn generating a substantial cost savings to the customer.\n  * Reduces the customer’s environmental liability.\n  * Identifies facilities that can accept the material and corresponding costs. This allows our customers to estimate how much time will be needed to remove the soil from the site ultimately saving time and money.\n### Trusted in all sectors\n# URL: https://www.cleanearthinc.com/services/environmental-waste-services\n## Utility\n## CTA\n# Environmental & Waste services\n## Hazardous & Non-hazardous waste services\nComprehensive hazardous and non-hazardous waste disposal and recycling solutions, customized with your needs in mind.\n## Our Services\n### Safely managing all of your hazardous & non-hazardous waste\nClean Earth provides the most comprehensive specialty waste disposal solution for all of your hazardous and non-hazardous waste disposal needs.

Solidification refers to a process that forms a physical bond, encapsulating contaminates to the waste matrix.\nContaminant migration is often restricted by decreasing the surface area exposed to leaching and / or by coating the wastes with low-permeability materials. Stabilization refers to a process that reduces the risk posed by a waste by converting the contaminants into a less soluble, mobile, or toxic form. This technique involves the use of chemical additives to reduce the hazard potential.\nOur thermal desorption technology effectively processes and treats hazardous, non-hazardous, and high moisture contaminated soil including but not limited to hydrocarbons, MGP, pesticides, and PCBs.\nAdditionally, treatability studies are conducted to determine successful solutions to site-specific needs. Based on the concentrations of targeted constituents of concern, testing will be conducted on an untreated sample to document the initial concentration.\nClean Earth owns the only on-site hazardous soil and sediment waste treatment permit in Connecticut, which allows the company to treat hazardous soil and sediment utilizing mobile equipment and technology.\nThe remedial solution offers off-site liability and environmental impacts for transportation, therefore lowering the carbon footprint per project.

By marrying the need for disposal alternatives with a parallel need for suitable construction materials and the focused drive for a sustainable future, all under complex regulatory environments, Clean Earth has effectively created a new sustainable paradigm for the industries we serve.\n## Materials Handled\n Hazardous & Non-Hazardous Waste\n Dredged Material\n Soil Contamination\nReuse benefits your profits and the planet. Not only are we meeting your disposal needs with an economical solution, but we're also keeping the waste out of landfills by using a more environmentally conscious approach.\n#### We're key to a sustainable future\nUsing a combination of the known properties of the byproducts and wastes generated by our clients, in conjunction with market demand knowledge and research local to the sources of generation, Clean Earth identifies potential target markets for direct reuse of the materials themselves, or develops treatment processes to dispose of or transform and render the materials suitable for recycling uses.\n#### We find the market to match your material\nDevelopers and landowners that we partner with have a need for fill materials, and adding beneficial reuse materials into that mix can help them attain site permits. We diligently track market demand and conduct ongoing research on local sources of waste generation.\nHow Clean Earth helps\nBeneficial Reuse materials\nTypes of Beneficial Reuse Material\nDredged Material\nCoal Combustion Products (CCPs)\nDrill & Pipeline Cuttings\nTypes of Beneficial Reuse Material  Dredged Material Coal Combustion Products (CCPs) Drill & Pipeline Cuttings\nTypes of Beneficial Reuse Material\nClean Earth provides innovative beneficial reuse solutions for an array of specialty waste material such as dredged material, CCPs, and drill and pipeline cuttings. Clean Earth and the clients we serve seek to avoid landfills and utilize recycling and beneficial reuse applications for their waste materials.\nThrough these processes and services, Clean Earth has become instrumental in the reclamation of brownfield sites and abandoned mine lands along with the closure of numerous landfills that have been redeveloped into golf courses, public parks and commercial sites.\nDredged Material\nClean Earth provides innovative dredged material processing and beneficial reuse solutions for environmentally impacted dredged material generated through the process of channel maintenance and deepening projects. This dredged material, an aggregate of sediment accumulated at the bottom of a waterway, is removed to provide fifty-foot deep channels required for large ocean-going shipping vessels. Dredged material is processed through various means to meet specifications for upland beneficial reuse such as landfill capping and cover, mine reclamation, and brownfield redevelopment.\n  * Clean Earth’s unique experience as a “market maker” for beneficial use of our entire spectrum of environmentally safe recycled products allows us to quickly and consistently find beneficial uses for CCPs.\nWhether it’s a one-time coal ash impoundment clean out and closure or a 20-year ash production requirements contract, Clean Earth possesses unparalleled experience in the use of pre-treatment, handling and logistics necessary to place your combustion products into sound markets and beneficial reuses. Our engineered material can be recycled or beneficially reused for road base, brownfield reclamation, and mine reclamation.\nClean Earth's full compass of services for CCP management includes the research, technology, and strategy for go to market. For every CCP Management project we handle, we take into consideration that there is an early review needed focused from all environmental views.\nClean Earth developed the first PADEP permitted technology that allows oil and gas companies to recycle or beneficially reuse drill and pipeline cuttings derived from oil and gas exploration.\nThe diversion of drill cutting wastes from landfill disposal results in reduced utilization of vital landfill space which allows the resulting air space to be used for other residual wastes and municipal wastes that are not amenable to beneficial reuse.\nThe use of processed drill cuttings as an effective engineered cap at sites that are already environmentally impacted offsets the use of other natural resources as capping material at these contaminated sites. This minimizes the potential for the media transfer of pollutants to “clean” or un-impacted sources of soil/fill.\nNext Step\n### Trusted in all sectors\n# URL: https://www.cleanearthinc.com/services/professional-services\n  * Consent\n  * Details\n  * [[#IABV2SETTINGS#]](https://www.cleanearthinc.com/services/professional-services)\n  * About\nThis website uses cookies\nConsent Selection\n**Necessary**\n**Preferences**\n**Statistics**\n**Marketing**\nShow details\nDetails\n  * Necessary  13\n    * Cookiebot1Learn more about this provider\n    * Google1Learn more about this provider\n    * HubSpot9Learn more about this provider\n    * LinkedIn1Learn more about this provider\n    * Solarwinds1Learn more about this provider\n  * Preferences  1\n    * Google1Learn more about this provider\n  * Statistics  7\n    * Google2Learn more about this provider\n    * HubSpot4Learn more about this provider\n    * Solarwinds1Learn more about this provider\n  * Marketing  27\n    * Google3Learn more about this provider\n    * HubSpot2Learn more about this provider\n    * LinkedIn2Learn more about this provider\n    * YouTube20Learn more about this provider\n**__Secure-YNID** Pending\n**yt-icons-last-purged** Pending\n  * Unclassified 1\n    * HubSpot1Learn more about this provider\n**hs-cta-interactions#cta** Pending\n[Cross-domain consent[#BULK_CONSENT_DOMAINS_COUNT#]](https://www.cleanearthinc.com/services/professional-services) [#BULK_CONSENT_TITLE#]\n[#IABV2_TITLE#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_LEGITIMATE_INTEREST_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_PREFERENCE_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_LABEL_PURPOSES#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_PURPOSES_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_PURPOSES#]\n[#IABV2_LABEL_FEATURES#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_FEATURES_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_FEATURES#]\n[#IABV2_LABEL_PARTNERS#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_PARTNERS_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_PARTNERS#]\nAbout\n**Do not sell or share my personal information**\n## Utility\n## CTA\n# Professional services\n## Hazardous & Non-hazardous waste services\nClean Earth leverages decades of combined experience to help customers—from manufacturers to retail and beyond, safely comply with state and federal regulations.\n### HELPING CUSTOMERS ACHIEVE COMPLETE COMPLIANCE IN EVOLVING INDUSTRIES\nEnvironmental compliance is no simple matter, regardless of how much waste a facility may generate. As requirements evolve and regulatory bodies increase their focus on enforcement, adhering to all applicable regulations can seem like a blur of identification numbers, permit applications and mandatory reports. Despite this complexity, any business that fails to manage compliance and requirements can be exposed to fines and violations that have very real implications for brand perception and financial stability. Clean Earth provides hazardous waste reporting and consulting expertise to help customers manage the complicated demands of complete compliance.\nAbout our services\nCapabilities\nEPA ID & State ID Applications\nBiennial Reporting & State Reporting\nHazardous Waste Audits\nEPA ID & State ID Applications Biennial Reporting & State Reporting Hazardous Waste Audits\n  * The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state regulatory agencies require that most hazardous waste-generating facilities obtain identification numbers. The requirements for these ID numbers vary depending upon whether a facility is a Large Quantity Generator (LQG), Small Quantity Generator (SQG), or a Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator (CESQG) and also upon whether or not the facility transports its own waste. In fact, application and license requirements can vary between states and also within each state, depending on which agencies implement a given hazardous waste program. Clean Earth's reporting and consulting experts manage this complexity to ensure that all EPA and state-required ID applications are completed. To remove the uncertainty from compliance, extensive regulatory knowledge is used to verify that each facility has the proper ID number and license based on location, waste type and waste quantity.\n  * Once a facility has an EPA ID number and, potentially, a state ID number and/or license, they are required to track the quantity of waste generated. Among other requirements, the EPA mandates that Large Quantity Generators (LQGs) report waste types and quantities generated on a biennial basis. While SQGs and CESQGs are not typically required to complete EPA biennial reports, in some cases state regulators require that even smaller generators complete the report as well. In addition to biennial reporting requirements, most states also require similar annual, if not more frequent, reporting. In some cases, states require reporting for renewal of ID numbers or licenses. To manage the complexity of these requirements, Clean Earth's consultants help customers make sure that they are reporting the correct information to the relevant regulatory bodies. This helps limit customers’ risk of potentially damaging state and federal violations.\n  * Waste categorization can be a challenging process, particularly for facilities that generate multiple waste streams. Before an organization can satisfy applicable waste regulations, they must first document all waste generated by their facilities and classify them according to type (hazardous, non-hazardous, universal, infectious, recyclable, etc.). Clean Earth customers benefit from professional waste audits designed to identify and document waste streams and applicable waste management regulations. Clean Earth fully manages this process by combining insights from years of hazardous waste experience with support from state-of-the-art tools. Pharmaceutical wastes, for example, are characterized using our proprietary database of over 450,000 National Drug Codes (NDCs). All collected data is verified against multiple sources and constantly updated to maintain compliance with evolving regulations. Clean Earth serves as a single source for the complex data management that every business needs in order to remain compliant.\nNext Step\n### Trusted in all sectors\nPharmaceuticals\n###  Pharmaceuticals\n# URL: https://www.cleanearthinc.com/services/recyclekits\n  * Consent\n  * Details\n  * [[#IABV2SETTINGS#]](https://www.cleanearthinc.com/services/recyclekits)\n  * About\nThis website uses cookies\nConsent Selection\n**Necessary**\n**Preferences**\n**Statistics**\n**Marketing**\nShow details\nDetails\n  * Necessary  13\n    * Cookiebot1Learn more about this provider\n    * Google1Learn more about this provider\n    * HubSpot9Learn more about this provider\n    * LinkedIn1Learn more about this provider\n    * Solarwinds1Learn more about this provider\n  * Preferences  1\n    * Google1Learn more about this provider\n  * Statistics  7\n    * Google2Learn more about this provider\n    * HubSpot4Learn more about this provider\n    * Solarwinds1Learn more about this provider\n  * Marketing  27\n    * Google3Learn more about this provider\n    * HubSpot2Learn more about this provider\n    * LinkedIn2Learn more about this provider\n    * YouTube20Learn more about this provider\n**__Secure-YNID** Pending\n**yt-icons-last-purged** Pending\n  * Unclassified 1\n    * HubSpot1Learn more about this provider\n**hs-cta-interactions#cta** Pending\n[Cross-domain consent[#BULK_CONSENT_DOMAINS_COUNT#]](https://www.cleanearthinc.com/services/recyclekits) [#BULK_CONSENT_TITLE#]\n[#IABV2_TITLE#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_LEGITIMATE_INTEREST_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_PREFERENCE_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_LABEL_PURPOSES#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_PURPOSES_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_PURPOSES#]\n[#IABV2_LABEL_FEATURES#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_FEATURES_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_FEATURES#]\n[#IABV2_LABEL_PARTNERS#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_PARTNERS_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_PARTNERS#]\nAbout\n**Do not sell or share my personal information**\n## Utility\n## CTA\n# A convenient, compliant recycling program for small quantity waste generators.\n## RecycleKits\n[866.447.5177](tel:)\n Order online\nThere is no better way to meet your recycling obligations than the online convenience of prepaid Clean Earth RecycleKits.\nClean Earth RecycleKits are ideal for waste generators with limited storage space or a low volume waste stream.

These BU sites can be brownfield sites or landfills undergoing closure and redevelopment.\nSoil is imported to these sites for use as fill and grading material, in conjunction with its state agency approved remedial action work plans or landfill closure plans. Each site offers its own unique acceptance criteria for imported fill and is overseen by a third-party engineer responsible for review of each potential source of fill. Upon review of data and an assessment that soil is suitable for a BU site, Clean Earth will match the export material with appropriate BU sites.\nThe major driver that affects whether soil is sent to the traditional soil treatment facility for recycling versus a BU site, is the chemical and physical properties of the soil to be removed. In New Jersey, BU soil will normally fall into a category of residential or non-residential fill, relative to applicable state clean-up criteria. BU soil does not require treatment and is therefore taken directly from the source to the chosen BU site. Aside from meeting the permit acceptance criteria, BU soil must also meet geotechnical specification for compaction or slope stability. BU options offer the lowest cost of disposal option because the material is directly placed into the site and does not receive additional treatment.\nClean Earth’s Beneficial Use options offer another avenue for our clients to save money, while utilizing a secure, state-permitted and approved disposal option.\nNext Step\n### Trusted in all sectors\n## Resources\nAnd many more\n# URL: https://www.cleanearthinc.com/services/soil-sampling-services\n## Utility\n## CTA\n# Soil sampling\n## Soil services\nOur goal is to make a positive and significant impact on your soil remediation project and your company's sustainability efforts.\n Request an analytical review\n## About our service\n### The first step for contaminated soil remediation\nIn an increasingly competitive marketplace, Clean Earth continues to differentiate itself from competitors through value-added, sustainable solutions for our customers.\nClean Earth provides expert soil sampling services for soil projects going into Clean Earth soil recycling facilities.

These two numbering systems work together to provide comprehensive tracking of every pound of material moved from your site to ours.\n### Adding Value & Finding Efficiencies While Managing Cost\nLike many of our customers, Clean Earth is constantly looking for ways to enhance the value we provide while simultaneously managing costs. Waste transportation costs can add up quickly, particularly when waste is generated on an industrial scale. Efficiencies matter—every trip avoided, and every square foot of space saved has an impact.\nClean Earth technicians are trained to consolidate shipments and equipment (including vacuum trucks, tankers and other specialty vehicles) to efficiently collect waste and transport it for either disposal or processing at one of our strategically located Treatment Storage and Disposal Facilities. By deploying the most efficient transportation possible, including trucks modified to improve fuel efficiency, we further reduce both the cost and the environmental impact of each load.\n**About Our Team**\nOur transportation team serves a wide variety of customers across the country. All Clean Earth drivers have extensive DOT training in the hazardous waste industry including but not limited to a 40-hour HAZWOPER course, in-depth security, defensive driving, labeling and load segregation, forklift, and PPE training. Clean Earth drivers routinely assist customers in labeling, loading and placarding equipment. Clean Earth routinely receives accolades from customers in all different markets based upon our driver’s, dispatch, and transportation coordinator’s performance and dedication to customer service.\n### Trusted in all sectors\nPharmaceuticals\n###  Pharmaceuticals\nFinancial\n###  Financial\n# URL: https://www.cleanearthinc.com/services/universal-waste\n  * Consent\n  * Details\n  * [[#IABV2SETTINGS#]](https://www.cleanearthinc.com/services/universal-waste)\n  * About\nThis website uses cookies\nConsent Selection\n**Necessary**\n**Preferences**\n**Statistics**\n**Marketing**\nShow details\nDetails\n  * Necessary  13\n    * Cookiebot1Learn more about this provider\n    * Google1Learn more about this provider\n    * HubSpot9Learn more about this provider\n    * LinkedIn1Learn more about this provider\n    * Solarwinds1Learn more about this provider\n  * Preferences  1\n    * Google1Learn more about this provider\n  * Statistics  7\n    * Google2Learn more about this provider\n    * HubSpot4Learn more about this provider\n    * Solarwinds1Learn more about this provider\n  * Marketing  27\n    * Google3Learn more about this provider\n    * HubSpot2Learn more about this provider\n    * LinkedIn2Learn more about this provider\n    * YouTube20Learn more about this provider\n**__Secure-YNID** Pending\n**yt-icons-last-purged** Pending\n  * Unclassified 1\n    * HubSpot1Learn more about this provider\n**hs-cta-interactions#cta** Pending\n[Cross-domain consent[#BULK_CONSENT_DOMAINS_COUNT#]](https://www.cleanearthinc.com/services/universal-waste) [#BULK_CONSENT_TITLE#]\n[#IABV2_TITLE#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_LEGITIMATE_INTEREST_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_PREFERENCE_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_LABEL_PURPOSES#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_PURPOSES_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_PURPOSES#]\n[#IABV2_LABEL_FEATURES#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_FEATURES_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_FEATURES#]\n[#IABV2_LABEL_PARTNERS#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_PARTNERS_INTRO#]\n[#IABV2_BODY_PARTNERS#]\nAbout\n**Do not sell or share my personal information**\n## Utility\n## CTA\n# Universal Waste\n## Hazardous & Non-hazardous waste services\nWe ensure the safe disposal and recycling of dangerous chemicals that could otherwise end up in a landfill, and reduce the total amount of waste by processing the resulting components such as plastics and metals for recycling.\n## How Clean Earth helps\n### An integrated approach to solutions for universal waste generators\nClean Earth offers an integrated recycling approach for our customers producing universal waste containing mercury, lead, cadmium, and other substances hazardous to human health and our environment.
