# October 2018- Electronics plastics are becoming a pressing issue for recyclers.
Considering the uncertainty of the looming e-plastics issues, a recent article in e-scrap news showcases the discussion around what has happened since China has almost completely stopped accepting e-plastics from the United States. Plastics used to be part of the electronics downstream that had value, now recyclers are paying large fees to recycle it.

# CEAR Celebrates 25 Years!
  * [ February 7, 2025 ](https://www.cearinc.com/2025/02/07/)
  * 10:26 am


We are proud to celebrate 25 years of providing trusted electronic waste and IT asset disposition services. Over the course of these years, we’ve witnessed huge growth in an industry that hardly existed at the time of CEAR’s founding. The e-Waste and ITAD industry has expanded and changed with the same rapidity as technology and electronics have during this first quarter of the 21st century. With each of those changes, we’ve gained valuable experience and added to our collected expertise.   
  
From our early days to where we are now, our commitment to sustainability, secure data management, and innovative solutions has remained at the heart of everything we do. As technology continues to evolve, so do we, constantly improving our processes and integrating the latest advancements to better serve our partners and customers. CEAR is devoted to providing a solution for every need and continues to develop new methods, tools, and services to achieve that end.   
  
This milestone is not just a reflection of our achievements, but also of the trust and collaboration we’ve received from our customers and partners. We deeply appreciate the relationships we’ve built and look forward to continuing to grow together. Here’s to another 25 years of progress, innovation, and shared success.

Batteries are so ubiquitous in electronics, both rechargeable and replaceable, that keeping them out of the wrong waste streams is a great challenge. The consequences of not doing so include collection truck and facility fires, hazards to sanitation workers, and environmental damage. SB 1215 and AB 2440, passed in 2022 but soon taking effect, aim to update regulations to manage these risks and create product stewardship programs for batteries and battery-embedded devices.

## How Tariffs May Impact e-Waste and ITAD Operations
![](https://www.cearinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/How-Tariffs-May-Impact-e-Waste-and-ITAD-Operations-1-1024x678.png)
  * [ February 24, 2025 ](https://www.cearinc.com/2025/02/24/)


Sweeping changes to trade and tariffs will have effects across all sectors, but the exact consequences are difficult to predict. Differing short and long term changes in commodity pricing, disruptions in material availability and shifting demand are all possible. Including knock-on effects, it’s reasonable to expect noticeable price fluctuations among new electronics as well as the raw materials used to produce them. Here are a few things that we might see as a result of these broad actions.
**Higher Prices for New Electronics**
One of the most immediate and noticeable effects may be simple price increases. When tariffs are imposed on products such as smartphones, laptops, and gaming consoles, manufacturers and retailers often pass these additional costs on to consumers. Even devices produced domestically often rely on components that are produced abroad. As a result, higher prices can make new electronics less accessible, potentially driving more individuals and businesses toward used, refurbished, and recycled electronics as cost-effective alternatives.
**Increased Domestic Manufacturing and Demand for Raw Materials**
Increased product prices could contribute to growing pressure to increase domestic manufacturing. If foreign-made electronics become more expensive due to tariffs, there may be greater incentive for companies to establish or expand manufacturing operations within the United States. However, this shift is not without challenges, as many electronic components and raw materials are still primarily sourced from international markets. The raw materials used to produce electronics may see commodity price increases that benefit recyclers in the short term, but some critical materials like rare earth elements (REEs) are neither mined in the U.S. nor recovered during recycling in sufficient quantities for sustained production. Many REEs are produced largely abroad, especially in China, and are critical for electronics manufacturing. CEAR has begun recovering a greater variety of clean REE bearing material from electronics, but mining still makes up a majority of supply. Securing supply chains of these materials will continue to be an important focus for the industry and for government involvement.
**Increased Demand and Challenges Related to Refurbished Electronics**
The demand for refurbished electronics is likely to rise. Consumers and businesses looking to save money may choose to purchase high-quality refurbished devices instead of buying new ones. This shift can be beneficial for the IT asset disposition industry, as it creates more opportunities to refurbish and resell electronics that might otherwise have been discarded. On the other hand, the tariffs may also create challenges when it comes to sourcing replacement parts. Many components, such as processors, batteries, and circuit boards, are manufactured overseas. If tariffs are placed on these components, repair and refurbishing costs may rise, potentially limiting the affordability of used devices.
**Opportunities for the IT Asset Disposition Industry**
There may also be changes in e-waste generation patterns and the supply for ITAD providers. With new devices becoming more expensive, consumers and businesses might hold onto their existing devices longer. This could temporarily reduce e-waste generation.
For companies involved in ITAD and electronics recycling, tariffs present both challenges and opportunities. On one hand, the increased demand for refurbished electronics can create a stronger market for secondhand devices. On the other hand, higher costs for repairs and components may complicate the refurbishment process. Businesses in this industry may need to adapt by diversifying their supply chains, investing in more in-house component recovery, and exploring new methods for maximizing the lifespan of electronic devices.
The situation is complicated and outcomes are always hard to predict. While higher prices could drive greater demand for refurbished products, increased costs for everything from replacement parts to raw materials for manufacturing may create new hurdles. Companies like CEAR providing e-waste and ITAD services may not be affected as quickly as retailers, but they will need to stay agile, monitor trade policy changes closely, and develop strategies to mitigate challenges and capitalize on new opportunities.

Batteries are so ubiquitous in electronics, both rechargeable and replaceable, that keeping them out of the wrong waste streams is a great challenge. The consequences of not doing so include collection truck and facility fires, hazards to sanitation workers, and environmental damage. SB 1215 and AB 2440, passed in 2022 but soon taking effect, aim to update regulations to manage these risks and create product stewardship programs for batteries and battery-embedded devices.

## Next-Generation E-Waste Recycling: Smarter, Safer, and More Sustainable
  * [ March 17, 2025 ](https://www.cearinc.com/2025/03/17/)


Early e-waste recycling efforts were often informal, focused on recovering select, valuable metals or components, and had little dedicated technology to aid the process. Today, e-waste is the fastest-growing waste stream and one of the most critical to manage responsibly, ensuring toxic substances are safely recovered and critical materials are reused. To that end, the technology used to recycle e-waste has been constantly evolving and improving, but what is the current state of the art or even cutting edge? These advancements are emerging or in limited use but have the goal of ensuring safe, sustainable, and efficient material recovery.
**Advanced and Automated Sorting**
Automated sorting has long been used in material recovery operations using cameras and near-infrared sensors to identify various materials. More recently, machine learning and AI models are being employed to greatly improve sorting efficiency and accuracy. Powerful computer models are being combined with robotic sorting and advanced technologies such as hyperspectral and X-ray imaging. These technologies, along with automated disassembly machines, are set to transform electronics recycling by lowering long-term costs, enhancing worker safety, and increasing the range and volume of recovered materials.
**Cryogenic Processing**
Extremely cold temperatures can serve many purposes across different stages in material recovery operations. Liquid nitrogen and compressed air can freeze electronic components quickly to make them easy to separate from one another because of the way different materials expand and contract at different rates. This is particularly useful for lithium battery management because the extreme cold can embrittle the adhesives holding them in place and potentially neutralize the batteries for a short time to improve safety by reducing thermal events. Additionally, cryogenic[PG1] processing can lower energy demands and reduce hazardous waste generation.
**Closed-loop Lithium Battery Recycling**
Recovering the materials used in lithium batteries is important to reduce the environmental impact of mining and provide sources of material where mining is insufficient. One of the best battery recycling methods involves extracting and restoring cathode material for direct reuse in new battery manufacturing. By skipping the refining process and directly reusing cathode material from black mass, the energy requirements for recycling batteries is greatly reduced.
**Emphasizing Rare Earth Elements (REEs)**
Technological advancement has recently focused on increasing the recovery of rare earth elements and the components that contain greater concentrations of them. This is due to the cost and difficulty of extracting and refining them and their importance in manufacturing. Electrolysis can enable selective metal recovery from solutions and research into ion recovery polymers could make for efficient REE separation. To facilitate this recovery, dismantling machines and methods are being created and refined to efficiently separate and sort PCB-mounted components and magnets that contain the greatest concentrations of REEs.
CEAR is working closely with industry partners and technological leaders to utilize the latest tools and innovate new methods of sustainable e-waste recycling. AI-powered sorting, cryogenic processing and rare earth recovery are reshaping how valuable materials are reclaimed from electronics. While some of these technologies are still emerging, their continued development and implementation will be essential in building a more circular and responsible approach to electronic waste management.

Batteries are so ubiquitous in electronics, both rechargeable and replaceable, that keeping them out of the wrong waste streams is a great challenge. The consequences of not doing so include collection truck and facility fires, hazards to sanitation workers, and environmental damage. SB 1215 and AB 2440, passed in 2022 but soon taking effect, aim to update regulations to manage these risks and create product stewardship programs for batteries and battery-embedded devices.

Batteries are so ubiquitous in electronics, both rechargeable and replaceable, that keeping them out of the wrong waste streams is a great challenge. The consequences of not doing so include collection truck and facility fires, hazards to sanitation workers, and environmental damage. SB 1215 and AB 2440, passed in 2022 but soon taking effect, aim to update regulations to manage these risks and create product stewardship programs for batteries and battery-embedded devices.

Hard disk drives (HDDs) present a dual challenge when they reach end-of-life, one that is often accomplished by a single process: shredding. Ideally, drives must both have the data securely destroyed and recyclers must recover the valuable material. Numerous techniques exist to destroy data, but shredding destroys data and starts

## Secure & Sustainable Hard Drive Recycling – Why Magnet Recovery Matters
![](https://www.cearinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/magnets-hard-drive-1024x576.jpg)
  * [ April 23, 2025 ](https://www.cearinc.com/2025/04/23/)


Hard disk drives (HDDs) present a dual challenge when they reach end-of-life, one that is often accomplished by a single process: shredding. Ideally, drives must both have the data securely destroyed and recyclers must recover the valuable material. Numerous techniques exist to destroy data, but shredding destroys data and starts the recycling process in one efficient step. This, however, means sacrificing the recovery of rare earth elements like the neodymium magnets present in HDDs. So how can recyclers recover these materials without compromising security?
[Data destruction](https://www.cearinc.com/services/data-destruction/) remains the foremost priority when handling end-of-life drives. Shredding whole drives is often performed even after sanitization by overwriting or degaussing. Degaussing renders drives inoperable by creating strong, alternating magnetic fields that destroy servo tracks on platters. Shredding is a final assurance that nothing can possibly remain recoverable, but it doesn’t need to come at the cost of sustainability and circularity.
By introducing an automated disassembly step before shredding, recyclers can manually remove the neodymium magnets housed in the hard drive’s actuator assembly. This additional step also allows for preliminary separation and individual processing of aluminum casings, steel covers, and components that do not contain data, creating cleaner material streams. The result is higher-grade outputs with fewer contaminants, simpler processing and improved value. Meanwhile, data-bearing platters and assemblies are still shredded, fully maintaining the integrity and security of the data destruction process.
**Magnets**
The magnets in HDDs are usually impossible to recover because during shredding they are shattered and blended with scrap. These small but powerful neodymium magnets are used extensively in modern manufacturing, from electric vehicles to wind turbines. Their strength to size ratio make them irreplaceable in clean energy tech and advanced electronics.
They are also strategically significant. China currently produces around 80% of rare earth magnets globally, creating a fragile supply chain that is vulnerable to trade disputes and export restrictions. Coupled with rising demand, this has raised alarms about potential shortages and increased efforts to create a secure domestic supply.
**Getting technical**
According to a [Seagate Life Cycle Analysis report](https://www.seagate.com/files/www-content/global-citizenship/en-us/docs/final-barracuda-lca-summary-report-ams-3-24-14-10-1-2013.pdf), certain HDDs contain neodymium, magnesium, manganese, nickel, chromium, zinc, aluminum, and copper. All of these have been [identified by the Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/cmm/what-are-critical-materials-and-critical-minerals) as either Critical Materials for energy or Critical Minerals. Neodymium, magnesium, and nickel are likewise considered to be both highly important to energy and at a high supply risk in the short or medium term. Some processes for [magnet to magnet recycling](https://www.academia.edu/110574835/Analysis_of_energy_usage_in_Nd_Fe_B_magnet_to_magnet_recycling) also report a reduction in energy consumption of over 45% by eliminating powder production, not to mention eliminating the need for mining raw material.
Primary mining for neodymium is energy-intensive, generates toxic byproducts, and can lead to significant environmental degradation. In contrast, recovering magnets from end-of-life electronics reduces waste and keeps valuable materials in circulation.
While disassembly adds a layer of complexity to the recycling process, it pays off. Cleaner material streams improve the efficiency and value of downstream recycling. As more companies and consumers prioritize sustainability, this approach offers a circular path forward.
The future of electronics recycling lies in smarter processes. CEAR’s innovative methods protect data, preserve resources, and reduce environmental impact to enable a more sustainable future for electronics.

Batteries are so ubiquitous in electronics, both rechargeable and replaceable, that keeping them out of the wrong waste streams is a great challenge. The consequences of not doing so include collection truck and facility fires, hazards to sanitation workers, and environmental damage. SB 1215 and AB 2440, passed in 2022 but soon taking effect, aim to update regulations to manage these risks and create product stewardship programs for batteries and battery-embedded devices.

## Where Are Your Electronics Being Recycled?
![waste electronics collected in a bin](https://www.cearinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/E_waste_bin-1024x768.jpg) Source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:E_waste_bin.jpg Patrickewastenz, CC BY-SA 4.0 , via Wikimedia Commons no changes were made to this image.

Most of the garbage we generate daily is easy to let out of sight and out of mind with the knowledge that it’s being disposed of according to well-defined regulations by trusted authorities.   
E-Waste is different in critical ways:
Unlike most household or municipal waste, electronic devices often contain hazardous materials, sensitive data, and recoverable resources. Improper handling of these devices can lead to serious environmental risks, data breaches, and violations of state and federal regulations.
E-waste collectors know that ensuring proper processing means protecting public trust, complying with security mandates, and supporting sustainability and local circular economies.
**Not All Recycling Is Created Equal**
When e-waste leaves collectors’ facilities, where does it really go? If it’s a cargo ship headed overseas then this is usually where the chain of custody ends, and the risks begin.
In a short-sighted sense international processing is cost-effective, but it introduces greater risk with all the complex aspects of electronics recycling. This doesn’t mean compliant, safe, and secure processing can’t be found internationally, but it is unlikely to be cost effective against domestic processing after transportation. Likewise, not all domestic processing is equal but it affords greater accountability and control.
**The Case for Domestic E-Waste Processing**
Several key benefits make local or domestic processing advantageous for e-waste collectors:
**Secure Data Destruction**
Hard drives, mobile devices, and other data-bearing electronics are subject to strict privacy laws. Processors must be able to [demonstrate data destruction](https://www.cearinc.com/services/data-destruction/) standards and maintain full documentation. Local processing can allow for witnessed destruction and greater security.
**Safer Battery and Hazardous Material Handling**
Removing embedded lithium-ion batteries isn’t easy. It takes skilled labor, specialized tools, and safety protocols. Reducing transportation and handling dramatically reduces the risk of thermal events which can propagate rapidly in e-waste and cause dangerous fires.
**Chain-of-Custody Integrity**
Fewer custody transfers reduces the risk of loss or inaccurate documentation. Transparent reporting, secure logistics, and certified end-of-life processing eliminates blind spots and ensures compliance with local, state, and federal mandates. 
**Stability in Cost and Logistics**
Global shipping disruptions, fuel costs, and container shortages are driving up the cost and unpredictability of sending e-waste abroad. Some countries are [tightening enforcement](https://resource-recycling.com/e-scrap/2025/01/16/malaysia-eyes-improvements-to-e-scrap-import-procedures/) and oversight of e-scrap imports. Domestic processing removes that volatility and provides agencies with more predictable pricing and turnaround.
**Public Accountability**
Many e-waste collectors are municipalities or government entities and therefore stewards of public resources and held to high standards. Partnering with a domestic processor can demonstrate commitment to responsible, transparent handling of public assets and funds. 
**Sustainability and Strategic Impact**
Though often a secondary concern to compliance and security, domestic electronics processing also strengthens America’s material supply chain. When electronics are recycled locally, critical materials become available for U.S. manufacturing, reducing dependence on foreign sources and lowering the carbon footprint associated with global transport.
This is the circular approach CEAR strives to support to achieve sustainability goals and enable a more resilient economy.
**A Better Way to Handle E-Waste**
E-waste isn’t just another waste stream. It carries risks and opportunities that require high standards. Are you confident you know where your electronics are ending up and what happens to the data and material they contain?
CEAR works closely with collectors to ensure electronics are [recycled securely and sustainably](https://www.cearinc.com/services/recycling/) right at our facility. Don’t take our word for it, let us show you the proof.

Batteries are so ubiquitous in electronics, both rechargeable and replaceable, that keeping them out of the wrong waste streams is a great challenge. The consequences of not doing so include collection truck and facility fires, hazards to sanitation workers, and environmental damage. SB 1215 and AB 2440, passed in 2022 but soon taking effect, aim to update regulations to manage these risks and create product stewardship programs for batteries and battery-embedded devices.

Ideally, drives must both have the data securely destroyed and recyclers must recover the valuable material. Numerous techniques exist to destroy data, but shredding destroys data and starts

Batteries are so ubiquitous in electronics, both rechargeable and replaceable, that keeping them out of the wrong waste streams is a great challenge. The consequences of not doing so include collection truck and facility fires, hazards to sanitation workers, and environmental damage. SB 1215 and AB 2440, passed in 2022 but soon taking effect, aim to update regulations to manage these risks and create product stewardship programs for batteries and battery-embedded devices.

## Understanding California’s SB 1215 & AB 2440: A Guide to the Essentials
![](https://www.cearinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/eirik-solheim-mWTOR3Rx8l8-unsplash-768x512.jpg)
  * [ July 18, 2025 ](https://www.cearinc.com/2025/07/18/)


California passed two new legislative measures in 2022, SB 1215 and AB 2440, to address electronic waste management, specifically two different aspects of battery management. The new regulations are soon to take effect so we have set out to highlight some of the key points of these laws to help manufacturers, recyclers, and collectors understand their responsibilities and upcoming changes.
**Overview of the Legislation**
**SB 1215**
  * **Scope:** Expands what is considered “Covered Electronic Waste” (CEW) in CalRecycle’s existing program, specifically devices with embedded batteries.
  * **Objective:** To define battery embedded waste and improve recycling and proper disposal of this increasingly significant category of e-waste. Establish clearer guidelines, facilitate reporting, and promote product stewardship.


**AB 2440**
  * **Scope:** Focuses specifically on battery recycling and stewardship programs.
  * **Objective:** Complements SB 1215 by establishing clear battery recycling obligations for loose and user-serviceable batteries.


**Who is affected by SB 1215?**
  * **Manufacturers** will have labeling and reporting requirements for products containing embedded batteries.
  * **Recyclers** will have new standards for recycling battery embedded electronics and additional data reporting obligations for reimbursement
  * **Collectors** must prepare for handling, accepting and reporting a new category of covered electronic waste


**And by AB 2440?**
  * **Manufacturers** must join specific stewardship programs for batteries and create detailed recycling reports.
  * **Recyclers** will have clear guidelines for specific procedures from manufacturers and stewardship organizations
  * **Collectors** , which will include a large number of battery retailers based on the retailer’s number of locations, will have specified collection practices and obligations.


**Similarities**
  * Both aim to enhance environmental responsibility through recycling and product stewardship.
  * Both will increase transparency and accountability through detailed reporting requirements


**Key Dates for SB 1215**
  * **July 1, 2025** : Manufacturers of battery embedded products must list covered and exempt products in an annual notice
  * **October 1, 2025** : CEW recycling fees will be established for covered products
  * **January 1, 2026** : Consumers will pay the recycling fee at purchase. Additionally the covered products must be labeled with the manufacturers’ name and information identifying the battery chemistry. This information can also be made available online.
  * **April 1, 2026** : CalRecycle will begin accepting payment claims for CEW collected after January 1, 2026
  * Additional dates indicate when CalRecycle may make adjustments and implement reporting requirements for manufacturers.


**AB 2440**
  * **April 1, 2027:** Producers of batteries must participate in a CalRecycle-approved stewardship plan
  * AB 2440 also is set to replace the Rechargeable Battery Recycling Act of 2006 and the Cell Phone Recycling Act of 2004 on **Jan. 1, 2027** , and **Jan. 1, 2028** , respectively

Most of the garbage we generate daily is easy to let out of sight and out of mind with the knowledge that it’s being disposed of according to well-defined regulations by trusted authorities. E-Waste is different in critical ways: Unlike most household or municipal waste, electronic devices often contain hazardous materials,

The R2v3 certification comprehensively outlines best practices for [electronics repair](https://www.cearinc.com/services/itad/) and recycling with a focus on environmental stewardship. CEAR processes all electronics locally and all outputs are sent only to audited downstream refineries. [Our recycling operations](https://www.cearinc.com/services/recycling/) promote a truly circular lifecycle of materials that are diverted from landfills and reused in new products.
TRUE
[TRUE](https://true.gbci.org/)(Total Resource Use and Efficiency) certification is a leadership standard that helps facilities and organizations measure, improve and recognize zero waste performance by encouraging the adoption of sustainable resource management and reduction practices. TRUE projects divert 90% or more of their waste from landfill, incineration (waste-to-energy), and the environment.
ISO 9001
ISO 9001 gives CEAR the tools to consistently and continually monitor our operations so that we may improve quality across all different facets of our services.
ISO 45001
The ISO 45001 certification provides guidance during health and safety assessments so CEAR is able to reduce risks throughout the operational workflow and control hazards for the protection of our employees and customers alike.

## Sustainability
[Home](https://www.cearinc.com/) » [About](https://www.cearinc.com/about-cear/) » **Sustainability**
CEAR conducts all operations with the goal of creating a sustainable circular economy of electronics. Beyond just recycling materials, CEAR is continuously exploring alternative means of reducing our carbon footprint and improving the environmental benefits of our practice.
Renewable Energy Plan
CEAR is committed to transitioning to 100% renewable energy use in our facilities.
We are working with our local utility provider, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), to switch to carbon-free electricity sources they have announced [Zero Carbon Plan](https://www.smud.org/en/Corporate/Environmental-Leadership/2030-Clean-Energy-Vision) to eliminate 100% of greenhouse gas emissions from electric generation by 2030. Currently, we have made provisions to guarantee that a majority of the electricity we use is generated from renewable sources.
We plan to invest annually to convert our warehouse forklift fleets and other equipment to electric within 3 years. We will convert all vehicles including cars, vans, and trucks to electric within 6 years. We will continually optimize energy efficiency through entire processing.
We will work with local governments, businesses, and communities to promote zero-emission generated resources and energy efficiency-driven programs. We will look for opportunities to incentivize our customers and supplies to improve energy efficiency by increasing the usage of renewable energy to convert fossil fuel systems into renewable electricity.
Recyclability Assessments 
CEAR offers recyclability assessments for our customers during the product design cycle. The ease of disassembly, reusability, and recyclability are evaluated to assist in making choices of materials. CEAR cooperates with customers’ design and engineer teams to increase the recyclability rate in end-of-life electronic products. The collaboration between OEM and CEAR drives further achievement of environmental and economic goals. 
Post Consumer Recycled Plastics
Plastic ([e-plastics](https://www.cearinc.com/2018/10/25/october-2018-electronics-plastics-are-becoming-a-pressing-issue-for-recyclers/)) is one of the most significant constituents of electronic waste. Traditional recycling of e-plastics is insufficient and generates contaminated wastewater. CEAR collaborates with plastic recyclers and manufacturers to promote the use of PCR plastics. 
By collaborating on collection, refining, and formulary adjustments, the e-plastics from CEAR operations are redirected from landfills to manufacturers of new electronics. The PCR plastic products produced by our partners have incorporated reused rABS, rPC/ABS, rPC and rHIPS varieties These products have also achieved UL and TUV certification for sustainability during production.

## Secure Data Destruction
[Home](https://www.cearinc.com/) » [Services](https://www.cearinc.com/services/) » **Data Destruction**
Data security is easily the most important consideration for any organization disposing of data-bearing end-of-life electronics and storage media. 
According to IBM, in 2021 data breach costs reached an all-time high with an average cost of $4.24 million per breach. 
It is important to minimize the handling of data bearing devices and limit the amount of time recently retired assets are stored.

## Destruction And Decomissioning
[Home](https://www.cearinc.com/) » [Services](https://www.cearinc.com/services/) » **Destruction and Decommissioning**
Proprietary equipment, outdated or disused technology, and branded assets can be a large portion of the end-of-life material produced by operations and facilities. 
Disposal programs must include assured and verifiable destruction to protect both data and intellectual property. 
For businesses, mitigating risks here means considering the specific needs of the business and of the material.
## Customized Solutions
CEAR knows that no one-size-fits-all solution is adequate for the different needs of every business. 
A complete solution will be tailored to the program’s specific goals and consider the sources and security needs of equipment. Customized services will also optimize the cost and efficiency of processes. 
CEAR offers ways to improve any existing program by handling proprietary assets, off warranty, returned or recalled products and performing hardware destruction. 
## Compliance and Risk Mitigation
The mishandling of assets can expose businesses to risks that include regulatory non-compliance, data breaches, and reputational damage. Environmental concerns should also be factored into any asset destruction program. 
CEAR’s Certified asset destruction programs provide businesses with peace of mind by adhering to industry standards and legal requirements, incorporating sustainable practices without sacrificing security. 
## Protection of Intellectual Property and Data
Proprietary assets represent valuable intellectual property that must be protected. Data can also exist on various equipment or hardware and should always be handled securely regardless of how sensitive the information may be. 
CEAR provides secure and confidential disposal of such assets, ensuring that information is entirely inaccessible. 
Our full chain of custody tracking also ensures complete accountability and security. 
CEAR can customize services to achieve our customers’ goals while minimizing any environmental and financial exposure caused by mismanagement of assets. 
Our certified asset destruction program has been designed for the highest level of service. 
Contact CEAR to create a custom solution and improve your asset management program.

## IT Asset Disposition​
IT asset disposition is the process that ensures an organization’s electronic equipment is managed securely and responsibly once it is deemed no longer useful or needed. 
CEAR’s ITAD solutions are designed to achieve maximum efficiency at the greatest value for our customers. 
Updating or Upgrading your IT assets? Our disposition services are tailored to meet your specific needs and guarantee the highest standards of data protection, value recovery, and compliance with all corporate and environmental regulations. 
### How it works:

## Device Assessment
We determine what must be done to ensure complete data security and what the best way to recover value from each device will be. 
## Asset Tracking
Assets only move once, from your location to ours, and all transportation is tracked via GPS. Serial numbers of each device are recorded using our asset tracking software for complete chain-of-custody control.
## Data Sanitization
All identifying labels and all data are removed from devices. Storage media is destroyed if required.
## Refurbishment
Devices are then prepared for either resale or recycling depending on the needs of the customer and the value that can be recovered.
## Recycling
Recycling takes place in-house and all recovered component materials are sent only to audited downstream processors and refineries. 
## Transparent Closed-Loop
Throughout the process, devices never leave our secured facility and CEAR is committed to providing end to end transparency of our closed loop service.

Retired assets _can_ be a security liability, but the right ITAD strategy will provide valuable returns and eliminate data breach risks.

## CEAR Recycling
[Home](https://www.cearinc.com/) » [Services](https://www.cearinc.com/services/) » **Recycling**
CEAR’s comprehensive demanufacturing and recycling services are optimized to be cost effective and environmentally sustainable.
All materials that we accept are processed in house at our facility eliminating chain of custody issues and ensuring security and accountability.
![](https://www.cearinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Home-Recycling-1024x683-1.jpg)
### How it works:
Our innovative and advanced technology utilizes centrifugal forces to break apart end-of-life electronics at their weakest points, separating whole components and materials.
The CEAR process produces cleaner outputs and uses approximately 30% less energy than traditional knife shredders.
Automated machine processing then further sorts and separates the materials.
Our highly efficient systems can recover materials from thousands of tons of electronic waste every year.
