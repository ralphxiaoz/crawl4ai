There are two mistakes we all want to avoid:\n### Mistake #1- Throwing away the wrong stuff or too much stuff\nThe more you throw away, the more it costs. The more you throw away, the worse for the environment. If you throw away the wrong stuff (confidential data, e-waste, batteries, etc.) there could be negative consequences.\n**Solution- Have all data storage destroyed, sell as much usable stuff as possible, recycle what is left.**\nShred the paper, destroy digital data, recycle the bad stuff, take no chances. If you have the time, you can often sell office furniture in good condition on Craigslist or Offer Up. Most furniture and equipment are recyclable, so in the end, very little should go as trash.\n### Mistake #2- Spending too much time and money\nYou don’t want to spend any more time or money than you absolutely have to. Your project could require a waste hauler, a shredding company, an e-waste company, a scrap metals recycler, laborers and someone to orchestrate the whole project. You can easily spend way more than you expected.\n**Solution- Get the help you need to make it cost effective and simple**\nOne way or another, you will need help. The question is, how do you make sure you have the right help? Here’s a checklist to assist in choosing:\n  * Do they have staff trained in waste reduction and recycling\n  * Can they shred and destroy your paper, hard drives and other media\n  * Can they provide the labor and the hauling of all your materials\n  * Can they recycle furniture, e-waste, paper, etc.\nIf you want to be sure you are paying as little as possible and throwing away only what you must, click on the link for a free quote.\n### Contact us to learn how to avoid the two most common mistakes and make it a simple success.\n## Recent news\nAll Posts\nDownsizing or Closing Your Facility?\nAll Posts\n# URL: https://modernwastesolutions.com/industry-insights-posts/how-e-waste-recycling-supports-corporate-sustainability-goals\nJune 14, 2025\n# How E-Waste Recycling Supports Corporate Sustainability Goals\nRecycling your electronics is an easy win for your organization’s ESG and sustainability programs.\nMore companies are setting ambitious Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) targets.

These materials can include lead, zinc, nickel-cadmium, sulfuric acid, mercury, plastic, lithium, and more. By using an R2 Certified recycler like Modern Waste, you ensure that these dangerous substances do not contaminate local landfills or waterways.\n## Battery Recycling Services We Offer\nModern Waste provides all aspects of battery recycling with emphasis on compliance and logistics challenges. Services include, but are not limited to:\n### Battery Types We Recycle\n  * Alkaline Batteries\n  * EV Batteries\n  * Lithium-Ion (L-ion) Batteries\n  * Lithium Primary Batteries\n  * Lead Acid Batteries\n  * Mixed Batteries\n  * Nickel Cadmium (NiCd) Batteries\n  * Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMh) Batteries\n  * Rechargeable Batteries\n  * Various Other Types of Batteries\n### Additional Services\n  * Battery Sorting\n  * Battery Insulating and Packaging\n  * Battery Containers for Storage and Transportation\n  * Compliance and Logistics Consulting\n  * Pick-up, Transportation, and Handling\n  * Proper Labeling and Signage\n  * UPS System Deinstallation and Recycling\n  * On-site EV Battery Safety-Tear-Down\n## Battery Recycling Process\nEach type of battery has different processes for material recovery and recycling. For example, lithium-ion tool batteries may be handled differently than lithium-ion cell phone batteries, even though they share the same chemistry. Tool batteries are typically composed of a group of smaller cells that can be tested and reused if viable; the rest are processed for material recovery.\n### Sample Process\n**Whole Lead Acid Batteries** are processed through the following steps:**‍**\n  1. **Plastic** components are washed, dried, and converted into plastic pellets for reuse in battery cases.\n  2. **Lead** parts are melted, purified, and poured into ingots for manufacturing new batteries.\n  3. **Battery Acid** is either neutralized into clean water or converted into sodium sulfate for industrial use.\nThis is a closed-loop process, where up to 98% of lead acid batteries are recycled into new ones.\n## How Does Modern Waste Help You?\nModern Waste makes it easy for you to access comprehensive and compliant battery recycling services that align with all local, state, and federal regulations\n  1. We will provide the equipment you need\n  2. We will train you on what you need to know\n  3. We will come to you to pick up (or you can drop off)\n  4.

The phrase _“Today’s waste, tomorrow’s resources”_ perfectly captures our approach: **minimize environmental impact** while **maximizing the value** recovered from materials.\nWhen we talk about sustainability, we focus on two key outcomes:\n  * **Minimizing environmental harm**\n  * **Maximizing material value**\n###  **Levels of Sustainability**\nNot all sustainable practices are created equal. Here’s how we prioritize them:\n  1. **Full Reuse (Highest Impact)**\nReusing whole devices as they were originally manufactured is the gold standard. It avoids additional energy usage and **adds immediate value back** to your bottom line.\n  2. **Component Reuse**\nEven if a device can’t be reused in full, parts can still be salvaged and repurposed—**minimizing manufacturing demands** and waste.\n  3. **Recycling (Last Resort)**\nRecycling requires energy to **separate, melt down, and refine** raw materials. While still better than disposal, it **consumes resources** and creates emissions.\n###  **Real Examples of Sustainable Practices**\n####  **🖥️ Computers**\nEvery computer has a useful lifespan, much of it dictated by software compatibility.\n  * If a system can still run current software, we **sanitize the data** , **test the hardware** , and **return it to the market for reuse**.\n  * If it can’t, we **salvage components** to reduce the need for manufacturing new parts.\n####  **🔋 Alkaline Batteries**\nAlkaline batteries are **shredded and separated** using heat or chemicals. The recovered materials include:\n  * Zinc and manganese concentrate\n  * Steel\n  * Paper and plastic\nThese are then reused in **manufacturing** , **agriculture** , and other industries—reducing demand for virgin resources.\n> 🌱 **At Modern Waste, sustainability means smarter systems, less waste, and real results—for your business and the planet.**\n#### Material - Mixed E-Waste\n96 gallons\n~200 lbs\n#### Material – Mixed E-Waste\n175 gallons\n~400 lbs\n#### Material - Mixed E-Waste\n1.5 cubic yards\n~500 lbs\n#### Material - Scrap Metal\n1.5 cubic yards\n~300 lbs\n#### Material - Lead Batteries\n27 gallon\n~120 lbs\n#### Material - Mixed Lights\n27 gallon\n~40-50 lbs\n###### Material – Alkaline Batteries\n###### Material – Rechargeable Batteries\n###### Material – Lithium Batteries\n###### Material – Lithium Batteries\n3/5 gallon\n~20/35 lbs\n## More steps to success\nAll Steps to Success\nPick-up\nReports\nTracking\nAll Projects\n##### Recycle responsibly\n##### Protect your data\n##### Reduce e-waste\n##### Stay compliant\n# URL: https://modernwastesolutions.com/steps-to-success/reports\n## Reports\n###  **Certificates & Reporting You Can Rely On**\nAt **Modern Waste** , we go beyond basic service—we provide **detailed reports** and **certificates of destruction and recycling** to help you maintain full accountability and peace of mind.\n> 📄 **Every pick-up is tracked, categorized, processed, and documented.**\n>\nFor each set of materials we receive:\n  * We **categorize** and **process** items based on type\n  * We generate matching **certificates of destruction or recycling**\n  * We provide a **report of what was received and processed**\nThese reports and certificates help you:\n  * ✅ Prove compliance with **environmental, legal, and data security regulations**\n  * ✅ Track your progress on **sustainability goals**\n  * ✅ Measure your **carbon footprint reduction** efforts\n###  **Easy Access Through the Client Portal**\nAll of your reports and certificates are securely stored in our **client portal** , giving you:\n  * A secure, centralized archive of past documentation\n  * On-demand access to any report or certificate, anytime you need it\n> ✅ **Whether for audits, ESG reporting, or internal tracking—everything you need is just a few clicks away.**\n#### Material - Mixed E-Waste\n96 gallons\n~200 lbs\n#### Material – Mixed E-Waste\n175 gallons\n~400 lbs\n#### Material - Mixed E-Waste\n1.5 cubic yards\n~500 lbs\n#### Material - Scrap Metal\n1.5 cubic yards\n~300 lbs\n#### Material - Lead Batteries\n27 gallon\n~120 lbs\n#### Material - Mixed Lights\n27 gallon\n~40-50 lbs\n###### Material – Alkaline Batteries\n###### Material – Rechargeable Batteries\n###### Material – Lithium Batteries\n###### Material – Lithium Batteries\n3/5 gallon\n~20/35 lbs\n## More steps to success\nAll Steps to Success\nPick-up\nProcess\nTracking\nAll Projects\n##### Recycle responsibly\n##### Protect your data\n##### Reduce e-waste\n##### Stay compliant\n# URL: https://modernwastesolutions.com/steps-to-success/tracking\n## Tracking\n###  **Total Transparency Through Data Tracking**\nAt **Modern Waste** , **data security** and **asset protection** are top priorities.
