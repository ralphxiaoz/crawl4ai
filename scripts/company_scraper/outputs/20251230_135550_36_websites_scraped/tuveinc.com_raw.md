#  About Us 
##  Who We Are 
TUVE is a recommerce company with over a decade of experience in the procurement and refurbishment of cellphones. Our focus is on providing sustainable and innovative solutions for the disposition of used electronics while promoting environmental sustainability, responsible data management, and ethical business practices. 
##  Our Method 
As a Seri R2v3 certified company, we adhere to the industry's highest standards for responsible recycling and environmental stewardship. Our state-of-the-art facilities and experienced team of technicians thoroughly inspect, test, and erase each device to ensure it meets our rigorous quality and performance requirements. 
We work closely with trusted carriers, distributors, and manufacturers to source devices, prioritizing the recovery of value from their assets while tailoring solutions to our suppliers' specific needs. Upon receiving devices, we immediately begin the data sanitization process, following strict procedures to securely erase all personal information from each device using industry-leading data sanitization software. If software sanitization is not possible, we perform physical data destruction to ensure complete data security. 
Our experienced technicians then use a 60-point issue identification system to diagnose devices and grade them based on functional and cosmetic condition. After grading, devices are repaired to our standards of quality and performance. Those that have reached their end of life are responsibly recycled in accordance with our Downstream Recycling Chain Procedure and local and international environmental regulations.
