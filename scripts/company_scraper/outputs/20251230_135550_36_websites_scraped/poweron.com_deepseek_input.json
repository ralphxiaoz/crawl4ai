The crawl covers multiple pages (Home, About, Contact, etc.).\n2. There is significant overlapping/duplicate information across these pages.\n3. You MUST consolidate all information into a SINGLE company profile.\n4. Do NOT output a list of companies. Extract exactly ONE company object.\n5.

This process might be overseen by an internal team(s) or a preferred vendor specializing in ITAD services. IT asset management, risk assessment, or procurement teams are typically responsible for management of ITAD. Their guidance will outline the requirements for data security, determine the replacement cycle for IT equipment, maximize residual value of retired IT assets, identify end-of-life IT assets, ensure compliance with corporate sustainability initiatives.\nImportant details that will determine your organization's ideal ITAD strategy may include but will not be limited to the data destruction method, number of employees, office locations, staff capabilities, available packaging materials, available storage space, parts for repair pool, inventory for spare pool, type of equipment, site security, or environmental compliance.\nDownload our IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) overview document, and discover the benefits of our comprehensive solution.\nGet an ITAD Quote\nPowerON will protect your company data while maximizing the value of your company's IT assets.\nRequest Quote\n### ITAD by PowerON\nThere are so many IT Asset Disposition companies out there.
