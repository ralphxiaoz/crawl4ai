In fact, the very core of our business model is based on these principles. Embedded in all our processes is the commitment to reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and avoiding unnecessary waste.\nThe Circular Economy aims to reject the lifecycle of the Linear Economy, which is based in part on the needless waste of perfectly good components. By adhering to the Circular Economy, we believe that we can still benefit from the ongoing advances and innovation that IT and technology companies offer, but in a sustainable way.\nEvery redundant IT asset, regardless of its perceived state, has potential re-use value, either fully refurbished for its original purpose or in its parts. These devices can be re-used by the original owner, sold to a secondary user, or indeed donated to charity. When IT assets do reach their End of Life (EOL), we believe that they should be recycled in line with the best environmental standards and nothing should be sent to landfill.\nBy giving businesses and consumers the ability to use their IT assets in an environmental and sustainable way, the Circular Economy is playing a crucial part in our global transition to net-zero emissions.\n#### Linear Material Model\n**Use and Dispose Model**\nTraditional supply chains assume virgin materials are used to manufacture new products, products are used and then discarded as waste.\nThe traditional linear materials economy model, where raw materials are mined, products are produced and landfilled at the end of their useful life, has proven to be unsustainable as the earth’s population continues to grow and we consume more products.\n### Circular Economy Model\nMoving from an unsustainable linear model to a circular model is the path forward to avoid depleting finite raw material resources. Reusing and recycling retired IT assets and electronics enables companies to benefit from better environmental outcomes and improvement to the bottom line.\n### DRM Services Enable the Circular Economy\nOn behalf of our clients, DRM is responsible for discarded electronics. We refurbish, repair, remanufacture and restore equipment for continued useful life. In addition to facilitating reuse of electronic equipment, DRM also recycles equipment, transforming waste to raw material. Recycling diverts material from landfill or incineration and provides a feedstock for making next generation products.\nWorking together, DRM and our clients can challenge conventional models of design, manufacturing, distribution, reuse, and recycling, in an increasingly global, value-driven, competitive, regulated and resource-challenged marketplace.\n#### Closed Loop Solutions\nWe encourage a more strategic discussion with our clients on how to manage electronic product lifecycles, reimagine supply chains, extend the useful life of IT assets and reuse and recycle products.\n#### Decommissioning FAQ\nSeven topics to help ensure your next decommissioning project is completed without a hitch.\nView FAQ\n# URL: https://drmcompany.com/circular-economy-explained\nIt looks like nothing was found at this location.

Clients leverage our knowledge about disposition of retired electronic assets, managing their movement through reverse supply chains, and quantifying the carbon impact of these assets.\n#### Reuse\nDRM works with clients to identify opportunities to reuse and redeploy equipment. This extends the useful life of IT equipment. Reuse avoids the emissions associated with manufacturing new products, reduces reliance on raw materials, avoids landfill and can contribute to localizing supply chains. It makes sense for your bottom line and your sustainability goals.\n#### Recycling\nRecycling obsolete electronics diverts material from landfill or incineration. DRM invests in innovative technology to produce clean recyclables that can be used as a feedstock to replace virgin raw materials in making new products. Extracting more value from materials, through reuse and recycling, is a good economic decision and plays an important role in the circular economy.\n### New Sustainability Calculator for IT and Data Center Assets\nRecognizing you manage what you measure, we have developed a sustainability calculator for measuring carbon emissions avoided by choosing to reuse and recycle electronics.\nDRM’ Sustainability Calculator provides our clients with industry-leading environmental reporting when reusing, redeploying and recycling all types of IT equipment.\nThe calculator is powered by manufacturers’ data on the 14 most commonly used IT equipment in the data center and workplace. Clients are able to calculate carbon emissions avoided from their IT asset disposition program, which enables:\n  * Aligning their IT asset disposition program closer to their corporate sustainability goals\n  * Making smarter and more sustainable decisions about managing IT assets\n  * Quantifying Scope 3 emissions associated with disposition of used IT assets\n  * Global decommissioning , data destruction, reuse and recycling services\n  * Improving value recovery\n  * Measuring and improving environmental outcomes\n### What is Reported?\nCarbon emissions avoided when reusing whole units and components, and recycling of IT equipment is reported from the calculator. In addition to tonnes of carbon emissions avoided, we also provide carbon equivalency metrics, which provide a user-friendly way to visualize the results.\nThe DRM Sustainability Calculator provides clients with transparent sustainability reporting suitable to contribute to corporate carbon accounting. Our robust and up-to-date data sets and transparent calculations provide proof points to withstand internal and external audits.\n### How It Was Built\nThe engine behind the calculator is independently sourced and verified and is regularly updated. It includes more product categories than others on the market, including a wide range of cloud materials. Energy consumption data is sourced by country. We use our own proprietary production information, including the green energy utilized in our facilities. This data yields more accurate calculated results.\n### Benefits of Working with DRM\nWe provide periodic reports to our clients, detailing carbon avoided by their current ITAD program. Because IT equipment continues to evolve, we recognize the importance of updating our calculator to stay in sync with the marketplace. We ensure that the information is current and relevant through regular maintenance and updates, including new product categories and the most current assay findings.\n### Reusing Assets Yields Significant Sustainability Gains\nThe new DRM Sustainability Calculator empowers our clients to quantify carbon emissions avoided, not only from recycling, but also from the reuse of IT assets. Most calculators only provide results for recycled assets, giving an incomplete view of a program’s total carbon footprint. Incorporating reuse data provides a more complete overview, providing clients with the opportunity to make more sustainable-focused decisions on asset processing.\nRequest Information on Calculator\n# URL: https://drmcompany.com/cloud-data-centers\n## Cloud Data Center Services\n  * Data Centers\n  * Cloud Data Center Services\n#### Smart Teams.

We have answers. DRM answers the most commonly asked questions related to data center decommissioning.\n#### Section 1. What is IT asset disposition (ITAD) for data centers and how does it work?\nData center ITAD describes the process of systematically decommissioning and retiring IT assets from your live environment and ensuring they are disposed in a data safe, environmentally responsible manner. Retired IT assets are resold on behalf of the data center, redeployed to another company owned facility, or recycled.\n#### On-site at the Data Center\nEquipment is decommissioned, inventoried and packed and shipped to an ITAD company that manages reuse and recycling of retired IT equipment. It is important that data-bearing assets are managed securely throughout the process. Most commonly, data is destroyed prior to assets leaving the data center.\n#### At the ITAD Facility\nAssets with reuse potential are refurbished and prepared for resale. If whole units cannot be reused, parts are recovered for resale. Obsolete equipment is recycled.\nMost data centers require a documented audit trail that confirms how and when assets were disposed and that recycled equipment was managed in an environmentally compliant manner. ITAD companies can provide complete chain of custody reports, sales reports on assets sold, certificates of data destruction and environmental reporting for recycling. A disciplined approach to data center asset management is important on-site, during transport and off-site at the ITAD facility.\n#### Measuring Success\nData center managers want to recover a percentage of their investment from the sale of their retired equipment. It is also important to ensure regulatory requirements, internal risk management and data security policies are met.\n### Create a Circular, Low-Carbon Economy\nResourceful reuse and recycling of data center equipment contributes to the broader shift toward a circular economy, decreasing the demand for resources required to produce new products and reducing landfill volumes.\nRoadmap for Circular Electronics\n#### An Important Tip!\nIndustry certifications are important in the ITAD and e-waste recycling industry. While industry certification does not guarantee performance, it provides a baseline of vetting to ensure your equipment is not irresponsibly handled. There are many reported cases of ITAD vendors taking shortcuts in processing used IT equipment. Shortcuts put you at risk of embarrassing headlines of data exposure and fines associated with illegal export and environmentally irresponsible disposal.\n#### Section 2. What types of data center equipment are included in ITAD?\nMost IT equipment can be reused or recycled. Depending on age and condition, whole units and parts can be resold. If no financial value can be recovered, equipment is recycled. Recycling recovers commodity materials that can be used as feedstock in manufacturing new products.\n#### Servers and Racks\nRack servers\nBlade servers\nServer racks\nBlade server chassis\n#### Networking\nRouters\nEthernet switches\nApplication delivery controllers\nLoad balancing controllers\nNetwork switch gear\n#### Storage Devices\nMagnetic hard drives\nSolid state hard drives\nBackup tapes\nDisk storage arrays\nStorage area networks (SANs)\nNetwork attached storage (NAS)\nDirect attached storage (DAS)\nStorage controller\nRaid controller\nStorage cabinets\n#### Electrical\nElectric cables\nPower cables\nCat 5/6 network cables\nPower distribution units\nFans, heatsinks\nUniversal power supply (UPS)\nBatteries\n### Decommissioning\nCritical Infrastructure\nDirect Resource Management (DRM) works on many data center projects. We are unique in this industry in that we provide decommissioning and disposition solutions for IT equipment, electrical and mechanical systems.\nDRM provides decommissioning and disposition services for IT equipment, decommissioning and recycling of electrical and mechanical systems. Our services are particularly useful for complete data center shutdowns and is popular when decommissioning edge data centers.\nDRM handles the servers and blades, storage devices, networking and electrical equipment listed above. We also provide secure hard drive destruction services. All work is performed by field technicians and site personnel to coordinate heavy equipment movement.\n#### Section 3. What happens to equipment after it leaves the data center?\nEver wonder what happens to your used data center equipment after decommissioning? There’s an entire industry set up to recover value from used equipment and maximize resource recovery, either through reuse or responsible recycling. This industry is known as the IT asset disposition (ITAD) and e-waste recycling industry.\n### How It Works\nEquipment is shipped to an ITAD facility specializing in handling data center equipment. These processing facilities are set up to triage equipment systematically, destroy data and prepare equipment for reuse or recycling. Some ITAD facilities handle reuse and recycling. Other facilities handle reuse and will send obsolete hardware and e-waste to a separate facility for recycling. Most commonly housed in an industrial warehouse, there are areas within the ITAD facility dedicated to performing specific tasks. These sites have taken on added importance as companies seek to reduce their carbon impact. Reusing and recycling data center equipment contributes to the circular economy and improves financial results.\n### 1. Inventory of Assets\nWhen received at the ITAD facility, an electronic inventory of assets is typically done and confirmed with your organization. At a minimum, asset make, model and serial number is captured. This information becomes part of an electronic chain of custody record to confirm secure and compliant handling of the IT assets.\n### 2. Data Destruction\nData is destroyed by data erasure, shredding, crushing or degaussing of storage media. As shown in the chart, data erasure allows secure reuse of storage devices. Magnetic hard drives and magnetic tapes, solid state drives and optical storage devices each require different data destruction methods. Certificates of Data Destruction (CODD) are provided by the vendor during the project. The CODD demonstrates compliance to corporate and regulatory requirements, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n### 3. Refurbish and Redeploy IT Equipment\nData center equipment can be reconfigured and refurbished and then redeployed to another company owned data center. If whole units cannot be reused, spare part recovery can be a smart option to maintain legacy equipment. Redeployment of whole units and parts is a great way to conserve resources, save money and reduce the carbon impact of your IT ecosystem.\n### 4. Refurbish and Resell IT Equipment\nIf there is no internal need for the decommissioned equipment, it can be resold on your behalf. Equipment condition and age of equipment is evaluated, to determine whether equipment will be reused or recycled. These behind-the-scenes activities help offset the cost of decommissioning, data destruction, shipping and reporting.\n### 5. Parts Recovery if Whole Unit Reuse is not Possible\nA parts recovery program provides an additional revenue source when assets cannot be sold as a whole unit.\n### 6. Recycle Obsolete or Proprietary Equipment\nAny equipment that is obsolete or beyond economical repair is recycled. The recycling process separates steel, plastic, aluminum, copper and precious metals from each other, which then allows for reuse of these commodities in next generation products.\n### 7. Reporting\nOnce resold, recycled or redeployed, reporting helps document an audit trail for the final disposition of all assets. Asset reporting should include detailed asset information, final disposition, pricing, and dates of significant activities. You should have the ability to receive data feeds or view online reports and be able to download .csv through a portal, which might include Certificates of Data Destruction, Certificates of Recycling and Certificates of Sustainability.\n#### Section 4. How do I develop a decommissioning plan?\n### Planning a Successful Project\nA successful project requires planning and cooperation between data center personnel and the decommissioning vendor. The pdf shown below serves as a checklist for things to consider to ensure your team is ready and selects a vendor that meets the needs of your data center.\nDownload Planning PDF\n### Data Center Decommissioning Plan\nDownload this handy checklist pdf, which covers these topics:\n  * Pre-planning to be done by data center\n  * Initial information to provide to vendor\n  * Define in-scope and out-of-scope activities\n  * Determine your reporting requirements\n  * Outcomes you should expect from a vendor walk-through\n#### Section 5 – How do I compare different decommissioning vendors?\nYou want to make sure your selected vendor is competent in the following areas:\nToo often, data centers depend on established vendors who currently provide adjacent services to also provide the decommissioning and final disposition of retired assets. An existing vendor will have the advantage of being familiar with your data center environment and the people on-site. The disadvantage may be that the decommissioning and disposition services may be outside their area of expertise.\nAt the start of a decommissioning project, the assumption is that any required data has been backed up, software licenses are accounted for, and cancellation of maintenance contracts has been completed. All equipment targeted for decommissioning should be powered down and disconnected from the network by data center employees.\nDownload Vendor Comparison PDF\n#### Section 6 – What hardware inventory information should I gather?\nAccurately identifying what equipment will be decommissioned is critical. Most data centers will provide the decommissioning vendor with a list of equipment to be decommissioned. The vendor will compare this list to a physical inventory count as equipment is removed from the live environment.\nKnow what your company’s policy is regarding how data bearing assets are managed. Have a plan for how decommissioned lease returns will be managed. Is there an area available for the vendor to work? They will need a secure staging area with internet access where they can perform inventory counts, data destruction (if done on-site) and prepare equipment for shipment.\n#### Equipment Information\nModel\nSerial number\nServer asset tag RFID\nDevice name\nEquipment type\nEstimated weight\n#### Equipment Location\nData center location (if multiple)\nGrid location\nParent/child designations\n#### Equipment Condition\nPowered off\nNetwork cables removed\nPower cables disconnected\nData bearing device?\n#### Let Us Help You Decide\nDRM is trusted across the globe to efficiently manage decommissioning projects and securely handle all data bearing IT assets.\nStart a Conversation\n#### Need More Information for ITAD Services?\nSLS offers a detailed RFP template for scoping ITAD services.\nITAD RFP Template\n# URL: https://drmcompany.com/ehs\n## EH&S\n  * About Us\n#### Environment, Health and Safety\n### Safety is a Core Corporate Value at DRM\nAt Direct Resource Management, sustainability is at the core of who we are and what we do.

Our goal when recycling electronics is to separate the different materials from each other. The “product” we produce from recycling is clean separated streams of recycled plastic, iron, steel, copper, aluminum, glass and precious metals. The better we separate the materials, the more ways these commodities can be used to make next generation products.\n## Step 1 – Receiving and Pre-Processing\nWe receive, sort and process computer equipment from businesses based on client specific needs. The client reports we are able to produce depends on how equipment is handled prior to being recycled.\n#### REPORTING BY WEIGHT\nIf the unit of measure for client reports is by weight, pre-processing will include weighing shipments as they are received and manual removal of hazardous items (such as batteries). When required, equipment can be sorted by type or material to facilitate more detailed client reporting based on weight.\n#### REPORTING BY ITEM\nSome clients need reporting by item instead of by weight. In this case, in addition to weighing shipments, each item received will be scanned and audited according to client requirements. Data is destroyed on data bearing items prior to recycling.\n## Step 2 – Hazard Removal\nAfter equipment is received, the next step in computer recycling is to remove and separate hazardous materials, including batteries, toner/ink, mercury bulbs found in some scanners/printers and cathode ray tubes from monitors, which contain lead. This manual process ensures hazards are disposed in a compliant manner and is important in providing an environmentally sound solution.\n## Step 3 – Shredding\nOur major recycling sites are equipped with automated industrial shredders, conveyor systems and sorting equipment. After hazards are removed, the computer equipment is fed by conveyor into a large shredder. The shredder tears the material into large pieces, about 2” to 6” in diameter. This first step prepares the e-waste to begin the process of separating plastic parts from steel, copper, aluminum, glass and other commodities.\nAdjacent manned support services include hard drive destruction, parts recovery, asset repair and resell and managing safe disposal of hazardous waste.\n## Step 4 – Sorting of Commodities\nAfter shredding, the conveyor belts push the e-waste through magnets, eddy currents, infrared cameras and air jets. These technologies sort out different material types and separate sorted material from the e-waste stream.\nIron and steel is separated from the e-waste, then aluminum, copper and circuit boards are separated. After the bulk metal is removed, the e-waste stream, which is now mainly plastic, is further separated into ABS from polystyrene plastic. In the final step, the plastic is sent through an advanced metal removal process, to remove any residual metal and improve the purity of the plastic stream.\n**Details of how we separate different e-waste materials are described below:**\n#### Separating Iron and Steel from e-Waste\nAfter shredding, conveyor belts transfer the shredded computers and e-waste under a powerful magnet, which separates iron and steel from the shredded e-waste. The steel and iron are collected in pallet sized bags and prepared for sale as recycled commodity materials.\n#### Separating Aluminum, Copper and Circuit Boards from e-Waste\nAfter passing under the magnet, the e-waste continues to move via the conveyor belts through additional mechanical separators. Non-ferrous metals (aluminum, copper and circuit boards) are extracted from the e-waste stream through advanced separation equipment. A visual inspection and hand sorting improves the quality of the extracted materials. The separated streams of aluminum, copper, and circuit boards are collected in pallet sized bags and prepared for sale as recycled commodity materials.\n#### Separating Plastic – A Closed Loop Solution\nThe remaining e-waste stream is now mostly plastic. We have developed and implemented best-in-class plastic separation technology that enables us to produce clean streams of plastic. Being able to separate one type of plastic from another is the most challenging part of recycling electronics. At the same time, complete separation of different plastics is key to using recycled plastic to make new products. We have significantly improved conventional recycling to truly close the loop for plastics recycling. Separated plastic from our recycling line is then used by compounders to produce plastic granulates that are directly used to make new electronics. This is a huge step forward in sustainable recycling as plastics are one of the most problematic materials to recycle from electronics. Few recyclers invest in this plastic separation technology.\n#### Benefits of Recycling – Recycling vs. Virgin Material\nThe separated commodities are used to make next generation products. Increasing recycled material in making new products decreases the demand for virgin raw materials, which need to be extracted from the earth. Using recycled material in the manufacturing of new products has benefits that go far beyond material reuse. It reduces pollution and carbon emissions, reduces energy and water consumption and keeps useful materials out of landfills.\n## Step 5 – Collection and Shipment of Separated Commodities\nAs each commodity is separated from the e-waste stream, the material is collected in pallet sacks or large cardboard boxes and shipped to another processor or directly to a manufacturer. Using recycled material in the manufacturing of new products has benefits that go far beyond material reuse. It reduces pollution and carbon emissions, reduces energy and water consumption and keeps useful materials out of landfills.\nDRM has earned a reputation of producing high quality recyclables out of our facilities. Manufacturers and secondary processors seek us out in using our recycled commodities.\n## Contact Your E-Recycling Advisor\nSend Us A Message\n# URL: https://drmcompany.com/leadership-team\n  * About Us\n#### Leadership Team\n#### Russell Spektor\nRussell Spektor, DRM’s Founder and CEO, is a graduate of the University of San Francisco and a serial entrepreneur.

Given budget restrictions and the importance of maximizing recovery while being privy to environmental regulations, organizations can no longer afford to allow assets to sit idle or dispose of them without care.\n### Remarketing Surplus Assets\nOnce excess equipment has been deemed for sale, there are remarketing best practices an organization should implement in order to achieve maximum monetary recovery. These include:\n  * De-brand, remove all stickers and signs indicating the current equipment owner to protect the brand from any liabilities.\n  * Determine estimated values for the equipment.\n  * Determine a sales channel for the equipment: online posting, private sale, local advertisement,\nremarketing via various domestic and international marketplaces.\n  * Adjust marketing to attract the right buyers.\n  * Sell, handle and ship.\n  * Provide a monthly sales report and profit sharing.\n#### Remarketing Services\n### Online Auctions\nIn cooperation with one of the largest online auction companies DRM hosts online auctions of used High- Tech, R&D, Lab/Test, and Manufacturing Equipment. Online auctions often generate millions of dollars for\nthe clients, capitalizing on equipment which has been replaced, completely written-off, or otherwise made obsolete. All auctions are supervised by trained and knowledgeable professionals.\n### Liquidations / Managed Sales\nWe act as a one stop shop remarketing solution for your used assets until all equipment items are purchased. This is especially useful for companies with unique or complex machinery, whose resale audience is very narrow.\n### Outright Cash Purchase\nWe pay cash for aa your used lab/test equipment and bear all costs associated with pickup, removal, transportation & storage.\n### Technology Recycling\nENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE\n  * Brand Protection is one of DRM’s core competencies. When Reuse and Remarketing are not an option, we destroy and properly recycle our customers‟ material in an environmentally sound manner\n  * This means not only destroying the units designated for destruction, but also tracking, auditing, and reporting down-stream material flows on a lot-by-lot basis\n  * Environmental Responsibility is of the utmost importance when processing any of our customers‟ material. For this reason\nDRM has implemented a company-wide Environmental Management System (EMS) to which all facilities comply\n#### Online Portal\n### TEST/LABASSETMANAGEMENT AND TRANSPARENT REPORTING\n### Global Logistics\nTAILORED FOR BIOTECH AND LAB ORGANIZATIONS\n#### Transportation & Logistics\n  * Any size, any location\n  * Coordination with 3rd party lease holder for returns\n  * Fully insured, tracked and documented\n  * DAP and DDP Incoterm options acting as Importer of Record\n  * Local currency support\n#### Onsite Packing and Removal\n  * Expert onsite packing system specific to Lab /Test Equipment\n#### Site Migration and Decommission\n  * CleanRooms, High-Tech, R&D, Lab/Test, and Manufacturing Equipment\n  * Project Management of all phases, including change/maintenance window coordination\n#### Asset Verification, Inventory & Reporting\n  * Inspect, scan and record any asset at any location globally in customer desired format / output\n  * Real-time reporting via secure Client portal\n#### Case Study\n**DRM Successfully Remarketed Specialized Laboratory Equipment for a Publicly Held Biopharmaceutical Company in Northern California Helping Them Recover Over $840,000**\n### Challenge\nAs one of Northern California’s leading biopharmaceutical companies continues to bring new products to market, it found itself with excess specialized equipment which was not best suited for the research and development of new products it is bringing to the market. The equipment consisted of heavy and bulky laboratory equipment such as incubators, refrigeration equipment, test and measurement equipment, and various exhaust hoods, HPLC, GC systems and Mass Spectrometers used in its labs. The client needed to reorganize its laboratory as well as its manufacturing facilities in order to accommodate new state of the art equipment. Their challenge was to recover the maximum value from their surplus laboratory, and research and development equipment to provide cash to offset its new specialized equipment purchases.\n### Solution\nThe client selected DRM to remarket all of their surplus equipment because of DRM’s unique approach, and its use of multiple online marketplaces. Having access to over 100 million buyers worldwide, DRM is able to remarket surplus assets to a broad range of customers ranging from end users to dealers on various platforms, thus garnering the largest exposure and highest recovery price. They continuously analyze historical prices of surplus equipment, and are able to effectively define the current market value for their clients’ surplus assets. DRM then identifies the most strategic buyers for the equipment in both domestic and international markets, providing their clients with maximum return on their capital.\nDRM expertly removed all of the clients equipment from their facility and relocated it to its 20,000 square foot facility in Fremont, CA. Once on-site, their trained personnel evaluated the equipment and separated the equipment for remarketing and recycling. DRM then selected the best marketplaces with the largest client purchasing base for the remarketing of surplus assets. DRM ensures transparency by providing its clients with custom asset and market reports.\n### Results\nWithin a couple of months, DRM was able to sell all of the remarketed equipment at the maximum prices allowing the client to recover in excess of $840,000. DRM recovered majority of residual value of their clients equipment and its value recovery program consistently recovers 3x more value than using traditional auctions and liquidators. The cost of pickups, recycling and disposal fees are offset by the recovery so clients do not have any upfront costs in the process. Partnering with DRM, the client maximized the residual value for its equipment and has saved time and resources that would normally be spent by their personnel to manage the process.\n### Have Questions?\nConnect with a Surplus Assets Advisor\n# URL: https://drmcompany.com/on-site-data-destruction\n#### Services for the Enterprise\nOn behalf of our enterprise clients, SLS is responsible for compliant disposition of retired IT assets and electronics.

No vendor will align perfectly to a single client. A successful ITAD program is built upon a proactive and informed client working with a competent vendor. If accomplished, clients will have confidence in knowing their IT and electronic devices are processed in a secure and environmentally responsible manner. To ensure a seamless and favorable transaction, it is recommended to evaluate your ITAD program with the following considerations:\n#### 1. Maintain a complete and accurate list of IT assets.\nMany clients use IT asset management software or ERP inventory system to generate an initial list of assets in need of retirement. This becomes the master list used in their ITAD program. IT assets not on the network are not detected by the software. Unless this list is validated with a complete physical inventory and cross-checked thoroughly for inconsistencies, errors are introduced before the ITAD process begins. Without validation, it is almost impossible to fully reconcile asset tracking through final disposition. Corporate Risk Managers should have access to an accurate and dynamic inventory of when and how each IT asset is disposed of and data destroyed. Common tracking identifiers used in cross referencing inventory include make, model, serial number and asset tag.\n#### 2. Prioritize vendor selection.\nYears ago, formalized selection processes for disposal of IT assets were rare and vendor vetting was mostly non-existent. Few questions were asked and most companies were satisfied with any service with the ability to quickly haul away their retired IT equipment. Gartner, a leading IT market research firm, released their first “Magic Quadrant for North America Information Technology Asset Disposition” report in 2010. Since then, we have seen ITAD vendor selection processes mature.\nMost large organizations today issue a detailed RFP to evaluate ITAD vendor capabilities and strengths. RFP data generally includes information regarding compliance, data security, sustainability and value recovery. It is recommended to not focus on only one capability because you could consequently compromise another. As an example, prioritizing value recovery can compromise data security, compliance and sustainability goals.\n###### Compliance\nOver the years final disposition of IT assets and digital data has taken on new significance to Corporate Officers, Risk Managers and compliance teams within organizations. IT assets inherently contain hazardous materials and ensuring all is responsibly managed and disposed of is critical to a successful ITAD program.\nIndustry standards, such as the Responsible Recycling (R2) and WEEELABEX standards, provide baseline assurance in the evaluation process. In recent years, there has been added interest in how the manufacture and disposal of electronics impacts a circular economy evaluation.\nData security requirements for disposing of IT and electronic devices have continued to develop since the United States created regulations such as HIPAA, GLBA, FACTA and PIPEDA forcing industries to think about controls, accountability, processes and security. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is one of the latest to make an impact on increasing regulatory requirements for international businesses.\nAs a result, most Corporate Risk Managers today require a defined plan outlining how data will be systematically destroyed with an audit trail. Audit trails show disposition routes, mass balance reporting, and certificates of data destruction and responsible recycling.\n###### Data Security\nA single instance of compromised data can be devastating for a company. Ensuring security of all data bearing assets is important. While no studies exist on the percentage of companies that allow data-bearing IT assets to leave their premises, Sims Lifecycle Services (SLS) estimates about 65 percent of clients require data destruction while assets are still in their custody. This percentage has increased significantly in the last three years.\nThe increase in attention to on-site data destruction services comes as no surprise. It is one of the highest levels of security services on the market. Aside from on-site destruction services and security certifications, it is helpful to understand a company’s security management structure. Internal communications, trainings, assessments, and continuous site analysis will provide more of an indication of the level of attention a vendor is giving to data security on a daily basis.\n###### Sustainability\nAs most companies are starting to incorporate circular and carbon-reduction processes into their business models, IT asset lifecycle will feature as part of the journey. Your ITAD vendor should be able to help you conscientiously reduce waste, reclaim raw materials for remanufacturing, increase reuse levels and incorporate considerations for the entire lifecycle of a product into the design process.\nIndustry experts suggest companies who will make it in the future will be those that “partner effectively with the entire circular supply chain to optimize collections, efficiently process material and find sustainable homes for the recovered commodities. Working with a single provider can reduce logistics, and is often more carbon efficient than multiple suppliers due to having a large global network.\n###### Value Recovery\nThe cost of a secure and responsible ITAD program is seldom budgeted in advance which leads many companies to seek revenue-neutral options.\nIf a company depreciates their assets on their books to zero they also will not hold a value on the books for them, even though they may have value when resold on the second hand. This in some cases can leave an ITAD program to be self funding or net positive. In order to do this, consider the following:\n  * Do not delay resale. When it comes to value recovery of IT assets, timing is everything. Moore’s Law is an observation of how quickly technology evolves stating that “processor speeds, or overall processing power for computers will double every two years”. Focus on IT innovation coupled with short refresh cycles are contributing factors in why IT assets can quickly depreciate in value.\n  * Minimize your risks. When commodity prices are low, there is less financial buffer for vendors to support revenue-neutral programs. In these cases, the chances of a low-cost vendor taking shortcuts increases. Low-cost options could risk inadequate protection from a security breach, environmental disaster (i.e. e-waste dumping) or non-compliance (i.e. not having required documentation in an audit). Value recovery is important but for larger, public companies is a secondary consideration after data security and compliance.\n  * Understand your vendor’s resale channels and strategies. A vendor who maintains active and varied resale channels (wholesale and retail) is preferred. When reselling IT equipment you earn the best value when you master the five Ps: Price, product, promotion, placement and people. Not all vendors consider resale strategies and understand best practices for maximizing opportunities on various resale channels. This can have a big impact on value recovered for clients. Analytics and pricing software is used by vendors can help inform these important decisions.\n  * Outline each vendor’s chain of custody. Moving IT assets from your facility to an ITAD processing center, and finally to buyers in secondary markets is a cost driver to be considered. Work with a vendor who efficiently manages logistics and is mindful of how these costs will directly impact revenue shared with you, as a client.\n#### 3. Understand lag times.\nProblems with irresponsible disposal of IT assets can surface long after an asset has been removed from a company’s live environment. This lag time can be the cause of major data and compliance threats. Data stored in an uncontrolled environment is only accumulating risk. The lag time between when a company removes an asset from their live environment and when downstream violations are identified, can be problematic for regulatory compliance audits. When an IT asset is removed from your facility for IT asset disposition or recycling, your company is still at risk if it is improperly managed. The links below document how irresponsible ITAD and recycling vendors have put corporate clients at risk.\n#### 4. Ensure legislative compliance and audit-ready reports.\nMistakes can be made as IT assets are moved, packaged or transported. This multi-step chain of custody introduces risks and vulnerabilities that need to be effectively managed. Ensure your chain of custody is clearly defined, documented, secure and as streamlined as possible.\nIf one stray hard drive turns up during an audit or shows up years later in an unexpected place, your company’s ability to demonstrate consistent processes and attention to detail will be jeopardized. This might also greatly affect liability assessments.\n###### Demonstrability\nFor audit purposes, it is critical to have defined processes to demonstrate discipline, due diligence and best practices in how IT assets are handled and data destroyed. Documentation (i.e. inventory reports or certificates of data destruction) provides proof that processes were followed and data was responsibly destroyed.\n###### Statement of Work\nWhen onboarding a new vendor, a written statement of work (SOW) often details how equipment is processed. This can be an important part of any corporate audit, as it demonstrates the use of a vendor who operates in a systematic and repeatable manner.\nA vendor should be committed to ensuring a seamless service transition by making your onboarding experience a positive one. Particularly when managing multiple entities across the globe, vendors should be able to demonstrate their tried and tested onboarding process which might include an understanding of tax and financial considerations (when working internationally), transboundary movements of equipment, varying environmental, data security and privacy legislation, and other international variations.\n###### Transparency\nOnce your processes are defined and documented, ensure accountability of the process and have an understanding of how you will manage it. Find a vendor who offers full transparency. A web portal option can be used to search for any asset at any time, and view an item’s status. If assets have been processed, a quick search using an identification number (i.e. serial number or asset tag) should provide details on the service, location and certificates if needed.\n#### 5. Maintain full accountability and make it integrated.\nFinal retirement of technology assets involves several departments within an organization, each with unique requirements. Partnering with a vendor who can support all of the organization’s needs in a streamlined manner can impact efficiency. Department requests might include:\n  * Proof of data security (IT department)\n  * Complete audit trails of IT assets during disposition (Accounting)\n  * Total value recovered from retired IT assets (Upper management)\n  * Assurance of environmental and security risk protection (Corporate risk managers)\n  * Estimated sustainability and environmental impact (Corporate sustainability managers)\nAn ITAD partner with broad capabilities can reduce administrative overhead, simplify vendor relations, assist in hitting environmental targets, and improve overall accountability. Vendor selection should consider immediate and future corporate requirements.\n#### 6. Create and implement a standardized program, then optimize.\nFor large companies many ITAD programs were initiated as site-specific processes. Today national and global companies are eliminating these fragmented regional programs, and consolidating and standardizing to a single program managed holistically and consistently.\nMost publicly-traded companies set and enforce requirements for the management and tracking of IT assets within their corporate environment. This discipline supports secure and documented destruction of digital data, and ensures IT assets are reconciled in accounting and IT records.\nChange is never easy so you can expect resistance from local teams, however a competent vendor can take the lead and offer solutions that deliver tangible business value. The goal should not be to replicate individual programs with a single vendor.\nIt should be to reimagine how you are handling the assets, leverage efficiency gains and improve your solutions, responsibly and efficiently. Benefits of a competent single vendor to manage a national or global program will typically include:\n  * Accountability of how IT assets are disposed of,\n  * Assurance that offices aren’t shortcutting systems and bypassing protocols,\n  * Reduction in logistics costs as handling is standardized and streamlined,\n  * Consistency in audit trails,\n  * Standardized invoicing and settlements,\n  * Guidance in laws and requirements affecting retired IT assets,\n  * Repeatable processes and audit trails due to defined roles and responsibilities,\n  * Competitive pricing from reselling IT assets in volume, and\n  * Bargaining power and favorable terms.\n  * Working with a strong IT asset disposition program can help your company ensure data security, brand protection and maximum IT value recovery.\n## Contact Us\nSend Us A Message\n# URL: https://drmcompany.com/tip-sheet-recycling\n  * Resources\n  * Tip Sheet Recycling\n### Tip Sheet Recycling\n#### **Evaluate Your E-Recycler Using These 5 Factors**\nThere are many electronics recyclers who might not recycle at all – they merely resell valuable equipment and/or export items to developing countries. This can expose your company to a range of data security, environmental and brand reputation liabilities. Here are 5 ways your company can evaluate your e-recycler before you work with them:\n#### 1. Review their compliance package.\nAsk for your recycler’s environmental, health and safety policy and verify their procedures. Are their processes governed by standard operating procedures (SOPs)? What security measures are in place to protect your equipment? Do they wipe hard drives to NIST SP 800-88 r1 recommendations prior to resale? Are they a member of the National Association for Information Destruction (NAID)?\n#### 2. Ensure data security is top priority.\nThe need for data security affects all organizations. Unfortunately, all too often, sensitive information is not secure, particularly upon equipment disposal. Ensure that your recycler is fully up-to-date with their current processes. SLS operates to the highest standards when it comes to data security. Our data wiping services provide peace-of-mind, accountability and assurance that our clients’ privacy and corporate reputation remain intact and eliminates potential compliance risks associated with retired IT assets.\n#### 3. Discuss on-site and downstream environmental management.\nYour recycler must manage your environmental exposure both on and off-site. Ask and identify where and how materials of concern such as batteries, CRT glass, and mercury bulbs are removed and stored. Is there an Environmental Manager whose primary responsibility is ensuring compliance? Off-site your recycler must conduct site audits of their downstream processors, especially for these materials of concern.\n#### 4. Review capacity and capabilities.\nElectronics are manufactured from plastics, metals, glass and precious metals. Advanced recycling requires large, expensive equipment which separates the different materials from each other. The “product” produced from recycling is clean separated streams of recycled plastic, iron, steel, copper, aluminum, glass and precious metals. The better these materials are separated, the more ways these commodities can be used to make next generation products. Advanced separation is critical in developing closed loop solutions which reduce pollution and carbon emissions, reduce energy and water consumption and keep useful materials out of landfills. An advanced recycling line can cost between $7M to $14M, depending upon its complexity. If your recycler says they handle 40M lbs per year, they’ll need a site of around 150,000 sq ft and around 100-150 staff.\n#### 5. Conduct a thorough audit.\nFor the protection of your company and clients, it is recommended that you audit your recycler thoroughly. This will help prevent the risk of confidential data such as credit card information, Social Security Numbers, medical records, or the negative impact to your company’s brand and reputation if their equipment is found dumped in Asia or Africa.\n**Ask about our plant tours and audits.
