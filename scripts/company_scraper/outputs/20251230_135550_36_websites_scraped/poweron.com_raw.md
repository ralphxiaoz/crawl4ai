# About Us

## Get to know PowerON
### Corporate Overview
PowerON Services, Inc. has been focused on reuse and recycling since 1994; far before being “Green” became a household term. We are committed to both the environment and our communities by helping to reduce e-waste in our landfills across the country, conserving natural resources, and providing access to less costly technology to those who need it most. Providing quality, affordable technology helps us to get one step closer to our secondary goal of helping to diminish the far-reaching negative effects of the digital divide. We reach these goals by providing simplified, full-service managed trade-in and recycling solutions, which include online trade-in programs and corporate shared revenue programs. By trading or recycling aging, unwanted technology our corporate partners and end consumers become our valued partners in these efforts.
In the past three years, PowerON has diverted nearly 5 million electronic devices from the waste stream. These devices were either properly recycled or reused and sold at a substantially reduced rate to those who need more affordable technology solutions.
In addition to our considerable efforts in the reuse and recycling of electronics, PowerON has taken huge strides to make sure our internal processes and every-day business practices mirror our external corporate efforts. In 2011 PowerON became one of just 280 California businesses to receive a Waste Reduction Awards Program (WRAP) Award from Cal Recycle acknowledging us for our green business practices.
PowerON is known for its success in the reuse and recycling industry, but we aren’t just a recycling company. We work to forge strong relationships with our corporate partners based on our ability to deliver creative, effective, and measurable solutions. Our team is driven to remove the obstacles blocking success.

## ITAD Success Stories
### Real Results: ITAD Solutions that Deliver Security, Value, and Sustainability
At PowerON, we partner with organizations across industries — including enterprise, education (K–12 and higher education), resellers, manufacturers, government, and retailers — to deliver secure, compliant, and sustainable IT asset disposition solutions. Our programs are tailored to each customer and may include logistics integrations with leading carriers, web-based trade-in portals, brand protection measures, certified data erasure, refurbishment, fulfillment, returns management, and other customized services. Every engagement follows strict sustainability standards, ensuring customers reduce risk, recover value, and meet environmental requirements while simplifying the retirement of technology assets.
### Enterprise
#### Streamlined IT Asset Disposition for a National Mobile Carrier
A major U.S. mobile carrier with over 1,600 company-owned retail stores needed a secure and efficient IT asset disposition (ITAD) solution. As part of a nationwide technology refresh, the carrier was upgrading point-of-sale Apple iPads across all retail locations through a phased deployment schedule.
PowerON worked with key stakeholders to determine the appropriate strategy to ensure a streamlined IT asset disposition process for all retail stores throughout the U.S. Each store received bulk packaging solutions with return shipping labels, and instructions on how to securely package the devices for shipment to PowerON's processing facility.
The success of the project resulted in a high level of customer statisfaction and overall trust. This led to PowerON being the vendor of choice for future projects of the same scale.

### Higher Education
#### Alabama University Ensures Secure IT Asset Disposition with PowerON
A leading state university in Alabama partnered with PowerON to streamline the secure and efficient disposition of its end-of-life IT assets. By leveraging PowerON’s expertise, the university safeguarded sensitive data, reduced operational risk, and ensured sustainable recycling practices while maximizing value recovery.
The university faced growing volumes of outdated technology from numerous departments within the institution, creating risks around data security, compliance, and storage. Internal resources were stretched, and recovering value while ensuring proper recycling in line with sustainability goals was a significant concern.
By working with PowerON, the university securely decommissioned hundreds of IT assets while ensuring full compliance with data protection standards. More than 1,500 lbs of IT equipment were successfully diverted from scrap to reuse, supporting the university’s sustainability goals and maximizing recovery value.

### K-12 Education
#### IT Asset Disposition for a Pennsylvania Apple Distinguished School District
A Pennsylvania Apple Distinguished school district, with over 1,500 MacBooks and iPads required a secure IT asset disposition (ITAD) solution. As part of its spring technology refresh, the district planned to upgrade devices before the end of the school year.
The district needed a solution to manage large-scale equipment removal across multiple schools with minimal disruption to students and staff. Security and compliance were essential, requiring certified data erasure, asset tag removal, and clear audit reporting. The district sought to maximize recovery value from retired Apple devices to reinvest in 1:1 technology initiatives.
By partnering with PowerON, the district securely and efficiently retired 1,500+ Apple devices while safeguarding student data, reducing risk, and maximizing recovery value. The streamlined ITAD process supported compliance, sustainability, and provided funding to support student learning.

### Retailer
#### National Retailer Launches In-Store Technology Trade-In Programs
A national retailer with more than 900 locations across the U.S. sought to implement a technology trade-in program that would drive customer engagement, provide flexible payment options, and increase revenue.
The retailer needed a trade-in program capable of supporting the in-store trade-in of devices, automated payments, easy verification for store associates, integrated logistics, and restrict access to the associate page based on IP address. The retailer wanted a way to leverage its web-based trade-in portal for additional revenue streams without complicating the customer experience.
Through its partnership with PowerON, the retailer launched a technology trade-in program that not only increased customer engagement but also generated incremental revenue through strategic advertising opportunities. The program balanced customer convenience with brand value, positioning the retailer as a forward-thinking leader in technology trade-in services.

### Lease & Finance
#### IT Asset Disposition for a National Equipment Finance Company
A leading equipment finance company with over 300,000 business customers across diverse industries partnered with PowerON to streamline the return and disposition of off-lease technology.
The client needed a scalable IT asset disposition (ITAD) program that could simplify the return process for thousands of off-lease devices across the U.S., while also guaranteeing data security and compliance with industry regulations. Their existing process lacked automation, created delays in refresh cycles, and incurred unnecessary expenses in managing returns.
PowerON created a scalable ITAD solution that streamlined off-lease technology returns, safeguarded customer data, and optimized asset recovery. By reducing costs, accelerating refresh cycles, and generating additional revenue, the program delivered measurable value for both the finance company and its customers.

### Manufacturer
#### Refurbishment and Resale Program for a Leading Computer Manufacturer
A major computer manufacturer sought a trusted partner to manage the refurbishment and resale of customer returns within the U.S. market. While the manufacturer continued to oversee the intake of returns through its existing process, the partner would be responsible for refurbishing devices to specific warranty and condition standards.
The manufacturer faced a growing backlog of returns that needed immediate processing to recover value and reintroduce products into the market. To succeed, the partner had to handle a diverse mix of laptops, desktops, and tablets with complete data security, and maintain brand integrity through approved packaging and accessories. Just as importantly, the program had to scale quickly to eliminate the backlog while supporting ongoing returns.
By partnering with PowerON, the computer manufacturer gained a reliable, certified refurbisher capable of transforming returned devices into revenue-generating assets.

All quotes are valid for thirty (30) days. We work with our partners, on a case by case basis, to offer quote terms extending past six (6) months for bulk opportunities.
#### Dedication to Partnership
Each partner is connected with a trade-in program manager. This manager requests feedback and fosters collaboration to improve all aspects of the trade-in program.
#### Packaging Materials & Shipping Included
Customers and partners incur no packaging and shipping expenses when using our trade-in programs. We will provide packaging and pay to have your device(s) shipped to our facility.
### How It Works
The PowerON portal streamlines the in-store technology trade-in process for your employees to minutes. Giving precious time back to the customer and employee to focus on the sale of new product. The flexible solution handles single device trade-in from a consumer as well as hundreds of devices from a department at the college or university.
1
#### Create Quote
Use the trade-in portal to select the product. Confirm the condition and functionality of the device by answering product questions. Enter customer information to complete quote.
2
#### Customer Paid
The store will then pay the customer with a store gift card, or issue credit toward the purchase of a new device. PowerON does not participate in the payment to the customer.
3
#### Ship it Free
Use the provided free return shipping label. Packaging materials are available upon request. We use trusted carriers and track each shipment to protect the device while in transit.
4
#### Store Paid
The store will be issued 2 (two) checks on a monthly basis. One for reimbursement for the total trade-in value, and the second will be 10% (ten percent) commission of total value.

# Compliance Recycling
* * *
## Corporate Sustainability and Circular Product Lifecycle
### PowerON is ready to provide your company end-of-life recycling services. We will support your Circular Economy and environmental initiatives.
It’s important now, more than ever, to protect the earth’s limited resources. Rare Earth Elements (REEs) are critical to the manufacturing of consumer electronics such as laptops, desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones.
The manufacturing shift to a Circular Product Lifecycle has created a new way of looking at product design and the handling of end-of-life products. It’s no longer enough to just have a recycling partner. Your company needs a partner with the ability to quickly pivot to support environmental sustainability goals. PowerON has a proven track record of delivering recycling solutions for leading manufacturers.

# IT Asset Disposition (ITAD)
* * *
## Secure, Effective, and Environmentally-Friendly IT Asset Disposition.
### What is IT Asset Disposition (ITAD)?
IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) is a common industry term used to describe the process of redeploying, repurposing, reselling, or responsibly recycling decommissioned IT equipment.
Most, if not all, organizations have an established ITAD process. This process might be overseen by an internal team(s) or a preferred vendor specializing in ITAD services. IT asset management, risk assessment, or procurement teams are typically responsible for management of ITAD. Their guidance will outline the requirements for data security, determine the replacement cycle for IT equipment, maximize residual value of retired IT assets, identify end-of-life IT assets, ensure compliance with corporate sustainability initiatives.
Important details that will determine your organization's ideal ITAD strategy may include but will not be limited to the data destruction method, number of employees, office locations, staff capabilities, available packaging materials, available storage space, parts for repair pool, inventory for spare pool, type of equipment, site security, or environmental compliance.

### ITAD by PowerON
There are so many IT Asset Disposition companies out there. How do you find the right partner for your company?
We recommend you start by checking for certifications such as ISO (9001, 14001, 45001, etc.) and R2v3. The most important factor to consider is data security and protecting your company from a data breach. Your ITAD vendor should be able to share the data erasure methods, chain of custody, security at processing facility, and Certificate of Destruction (COD).
IT Asset Disposition services through PowerON offer the following advantages to our customers.
#### Data Destruction
PowerON is in full compliance with all industry leading standards including: NIST Pub 800-88, HIPAA, PII Removal (NIST Special Publication 800-122), and R2v3.
#### Certified Facility
PowerON is committed to maintaining the highest standards within each facility we operate. Our facility is ISO 9001:2015, 14001:2015, 45001:2018 certified, and R2:2013 certified.
#### Value Recovery
We provide a quote with the estimated value of your IT assets. All quotes are valid for thirty (30) days. Assets must be in "working" condition to receive full value.
#### End-to-End Logistics
Customers and partners incur no packaging and shipping expenses when using our ITAD services. We will provide packaging and pay to have your device(s) shipped to our facility.
#### Detailed Reporting
After your assets have been processed you'll receive detailed audit and data destruction reports. Each report will include the model, serial number, and any other relevant information.
#### Compliance Recycling
We partner with R2v3 certified downstream vendors to responsibly recycle your IT assets. Our goal is Zero Waste to Landfill and we audit our downstream partners to monitor compliance.
### ITAD Process
PowerON has streamlined the IT Asset Disposition process for organizations of all size. Give precious time back to the employees tasked with managing decommissioned IT assets by utilizing our ITAD service. The flexible solution handles single device return from remote workers as well as hundreds of devices from an office location.

# Get Rid of Your Laptop Using Dell Trade-In Program
![Get Rid of Your Laptop Using Dell Trade-In Program](https://poweron.com/images/blog/2021-02-18-use-dell-tradein-to-get-rid-of-your-laptop.jpg)   

If you have an old Dell or laptop computer, you can trade it in fairly easily using the company’s program. You simply go to the website and follow the steps, entering the model and serial number of your laptop or computer, and they’ll give you a quote. If you just want to recycle it and don’t want money back, Dell will send you a free Fedex shipping label (you’ll need to supply the box) — you just need to fill out the online form.

# Remote Refresh Management
* * *
## Manage the Return of Remote IT Assets
### Remote Refresh Management Program
The Remote Refresh Management Program gives your organization's IT Manager a simple way to return technology from remote users directly to PowerON. IT departments are being spread thin due to an increase of remote users. This program was created to address the changing needs of a large organization with thousands of employees working remotely.
## Challenges
The IT team does NOT have the bandwidth to manage the return shipping, receiving, data wipe, storage, and value recovery of all the equipment. As employees are allowed to return to their offices, our partner’s IT team will be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of equipment.
The influx of equipment effects the following:
  * Management of return logistics (IT staff must communicate with all employees)
  * Timely receiving of equipment (limited by IT staff size)
  * Equipment verification (collection of employee name, serial number, asset ID, etc.)
  * Prompt erasure to protect company data
  * Quick resale to maximize recovery value of idle equipment


## Solution
An online portal allowing the employee to send any corporate asset to PowerON.
We provide the following:
  * End-to-end logistics
  * Rapid receiving of equipment
  * Verify equipment and record data (employee name, serial number, asset ID, etc.)
  * Secure data erasure (Certificate of Destruction)
  * PowerON purchases the equipment

# Packaging Instructions
* * *
## Ship your products safely to PowerON
### Safeguard your product by following the appropriate packaging and shipping procedures.
Consumer trade-in customers have two options available for shipping product(s) with value to PowerON after receiving a quote.
### 1. FedEx Pack and Return Program
This is the default and preferred method for shipping product(s) to PowerON. This method expedites the trade-in process by alleviating the time needed to ship packaging materials.
Simply take the product(s), along with an email you receive containing your Quote/RMA number to a FedEx Office Print & Ship Center location. If you forget the email, don’t worry! Just give the FedEx Office Team Member the email address used when creating the Quote/RMA. The FedEx Office Team Member, using the FedEx Pack and Return System, will provide the appropriate box, securely package, and ship your product(s) for FREE!
### 2. PowerON Provides Packaging Materials
This method must be requested by phone or email. It will delay payment due to additional business days required to ship materials to the specific location.
PowerON will send shipping materials and a return shipping label. When packaging the product, be sure to include all accessories (cables, adapters, mice, keyboards, etc.). Failure to include any items you told us about when the quote was calculated, or sending us a product which does not match your original description, may impact the final value of your product and may result in a recalculated quote.
