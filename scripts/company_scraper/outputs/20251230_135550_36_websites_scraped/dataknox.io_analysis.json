    "is_good_fit": true,
    "inventory_fit_assessment": "EXCELLENT FIT. Dataknox explicitly deals in the exact enterprise IT assets Yilong requires. Their services include IT Asset Disposition (ITAD), Data Center Decommissioning, and a Tech Trade-In Program focused on liquidating server assets and other IT equipment. They mention processing 55,000 assets and redeploying 3,000 devices each month, demonstrating high-volume capability suitable for bulk (pallet/truckload) purchases. Their product focus includes data center servers, networking equipment, and storage from major brands (Dell, HPE, Cisco, etc.). They have a Director of Remarketing, indicating an active wholesale sales channel for refurbished assets. Their condition grading aligns with Yilong's needs, as they mention 'redeploying' devices and offering 'Tested Functional' assets through their ITAD services, which complies with R2v3 F2/C3 or better standards.",
    "operational_fit_assessment": "STRONG FIT. Dataknox is a classic B2B ITAD processor and asset recovery firm, not a consumer-focused recycler. They hold the highly preferred R2v3 certification, along with other relevant standards (NIST 800-88, ISO 14001), proving their capability for proper testing, data wiping, and responsible recycling. Their business model is built for wholesale; they have a dedicated trade-in program for bulk asset liquidation, offer site decommissioning services, and operate a global logistics network. Their Base Camp portal is designed for enterprise clients to manage bulk asset disposal. There is no indication of a primary retail (eBay/Amazon) sales channel; their focus is on corporate clients and large-scale IT projects.",
    "red_flags": [],
    "recommendation": "Reach out",
    "reasoning": "Dataknox Solutions is a near-ideal vendor candidate for Yilong Business Limited. They perfectly match both critical pillars: 1) INVENTORY FIT: They specialize in enterprise-grade IT assets (servers, networking, storage) from data center decommissioning and trade-ins, handle high monthly volumes, and operate a remarketing/wholesale channel for functional equipment. 2) OPERATIONAL FIT: They are a certified (R2v3) ITAD processor with a clear B2B focus, global logistics for bulk handling, and services tailored for corporate asset recovery. No red flags were identified; they are not a consumer recycler, scrap-focused, or retail reseller. Their established processes, certifications, and volume make them a prime target for a bulk procurement partnership.",
