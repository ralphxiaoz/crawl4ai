    "is_good_fit": true,
    "inventory_fit_assessment": "Excellent fit. Iron Mountain processes exactly the enterprise IT assets Yilong requires: servers, storage systems, networking gear, laptops, and desktops. They specifically mention processing 'Servers, Storage systems and devices, Networking gear, Computer tapes, Racking' for data center decommissioning, and 'laptops and peripherals' for end-user device ITAD. Their Teraware data sanitization platform provides '100% sector verified erasure guaranteed' for drives, indicating proper testing and wiping. They process '1M+ servers and 3M+ drives annually' and have '10M+ drives sanitized' historically, demonstrating massive volume capacity that matches Yilong's $1.5M monthly budget. Their remarketing program focuses on 'maximized value recovery' with 'higher returns vs. alternatives,' suggesting they grade and test assets for resale rather than just recycling.",
    "operational_fit_assessment": "Excellent operational fit. Iron Mountain is a pure B2B enterprise-focused ITAD processor and asset recovery firm, not a consumer recycler. They hold both R2v3 and e-Stewards certifications across multiple facilities globally, with specific mentions of R2v3 facilities in Olathe, KS; Front Royal, VA; Drogheda, Ireland; Lulea, Sweden; and Singapore. Their business model is wholesale/bulk oriented, processing '150 million pounds of e-waste annually' and handling 'large-scale IT hardware deployments and retrievals.' They offer 'secure chain of custody' with 'vetted employees and sealed transportation' and have 'API integration into your existing ITSM platform' for enterprise clients. Their global remarketing network includes '80% of worldwide IT resellers,' indicating established wholesale channels. They are recognized by Gartner as a 'Representative Provider in the IT Asset Disposition Market Guide' for five consecutive years.",
    "red_flags": [],
    "recommendation": "Reach out",
    "reasoning": "Iron Mountain is an ideal vendor candidate for Yilong Business Limited. They are a global, enterprise-focused ITAD processor with R2v3 and e-Stewards certifications, massive processing capacity that matches Yilong's volume requirements, and exactly the right inventory mix of enterprise servers, storage, networking equipment, and end-user devices. Their focus on value recovery through remarketing rather than just recycling aligns with Yilong's 'High-Quality Refurbishment' model. The company's B2B orientation, wholesale capabilities, and established global remarketing network make them a perfect operational fit. No red flags were identified - they are not consumer-focused, not scrap-metal oriented, and have comprehensive testing and grading processes. Their $1B+ in remarketing value returned to customers demonstrates their capability to handle Yilong's scale.",
