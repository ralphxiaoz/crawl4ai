It affirms that ERI’s practices, policies, procedures, security, data integrity and operations meet the highest SOC 2 standards for security and data protection.\nSOC 2 independent audits are conducted to review companies’ effective implementation of employee controls and training, IT systems and risk management control, product discipline, and vendor selection. SOC 2 Type II, the most extensive audit of its kind, is an attestation of controls at a service organization over a minimum six-month period. SOC 2 Type II reports on the description of controls, attests that the controls are suitably designed and implemented, and attests to the operating effectiveness of the controls.\nDuring a SOC 2 Type II audit, independent auditors carry out field work on a sample of days across the testing period to observe how controls are implemented and how consistently effective they are in keeping potential and existing customers’ sensitive data safe, secure and fully protected. ERI has effectively met all SOC 2 Type II audit standards on a continuous basis.\n“Achieving SOC 2 Type II certification further demonstrates ERI’s ongoing commitment to security, data protection and the responsible recycling of all electronic devices,” said John Shegerian, ERI’s Chairman and CEO. “Our partners and customers can feel 100% confident that we have made and continue to make every investment and operational protocol to establish and maintain the highest level of security and compliance in the industry. Our successful SOC 2 audits are also proof that we are always willing and able to provide third-party, independent audits, testing and validation to ensure our systems and controls are state-of-the-art for handling data can be fully trusted every step of the way.”\nERI’s SOC 2 examinations for both Type I and Type II compliance testing were conducted in accordance with standards from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).\n_ERI_ _is the largest fully integrated IT and electronics asset disposition provider and cybersecurity-focused hardware destruction company in the United States.

(Source: BAN.org and PBS Ghana: Digital Dumping Ground)\nWe are confident none of these cities and institutions intentionally shipped their e-waste to Asia or Africa. However, it is an unfortunate result of budget constraints and government sourcing procedures when an unscrupulous low bidder or downstream vendor is awarded a contract. E-waste is shipped to developing countries because it is cheaper than recycling properly in the U.S. and allows unethical recyclers to exploit loopholes in U.S. law to submit low bids to government entities.\nIn addition to the ethical concerns, there can be a high price to pay for U.S. and state environmental violations – saving a few pennies per pound for e-scrap disposal could result in millions of dollars in penalties or cleanup costs.\nAs reported in E-Scrap News in 2018:\n> A trial is deciding whether federal Superfund law makes three South Carolina counties responsible for costs to remove CRT displays and other material abandoned by shuttered processor Creative Recycling Systems.\n> The case involves cleanup costs at a South Carolina warehouse that was used by Creative Recycling Systems (CRS). The company filed for bankruptcy in 2014, leaving 32 million pounds of CRT glass and other scrap electronic materials in storage across six states.\nThen there is the case of the now defunct Closed Loop Refining and Recovery. Major CRT tonnages were left behind by Closed Loop in warehouses in Arizona and Ohio — regulatory and legal action continues.\nThe Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) estimated that Closed Loop left behind approximately 158 million pounds of CRT glass at five sites in Arizona. The result is costly:\n> At the other 59th Avenue facility, which is owned by Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), according to documents from Closed Loop there are 42,396,000 pounds of non-leaded CRT glass as this facility; ADOT is arranging for internal funding to remove and dispose of glass, with an anticipated project start date before June 1, 2018.\nBeyond the environmental concerns and risks, local and state governments may be required to comply with the myriad of Federal and state law applicable to data security and data privacy. Data destruction legislation is in place for 14 states that apply to government entities in addition to possibly Federal requirements that may be applicable.\n###  Protect your Organization\nSo, the issue is twofold: government entities must meet the challenge of both protecting data contained in end-of-life equipment while also ensuring both data and non-data bearing electronics equipment are properly recycled to comply with all applicable regulations and to protect the reputation of the entity.\n**ERI is the largest fully integrated IT and electronics asset disposition service provider in the U.S. and focused on data destruction and cybersecurity** – ERI is the only company in the world with NAID AAA and e-Stewards certifications.

One might ask, how can ERI make such a bold statement? It's simple. ERI is the **only company in the world** that holds NAID AAA, and e-Stewards certifications. This means ERI is certified to the highest level possible for data destruction/sanitization and environmentally responsible recycling. There is no regulation in any industry or jurisdiction that requires more than what ERI is certified to provide.\nThat's why over 20% of the Fortune 100 trusts ERI to deliver services to them.\n###  Industries we serve include:\n  * Aerospace\n  * Automotive\n  * Aviation\n  * Banking\n  * Computers\n  * Defense\n  * Education\n  * Electronics\n  * Energy\n  * Entertainment\n  * Financial Services\n  * Government\n  * Hospitality\n  * Insurance\n  * Manufacturing\n  * Media\n  * Pharmaceutical\n  * Sports\n  * Technology\n  * Telecommunications\n  * Transportation\n  * Utilities\nContact us to discuss how we can support your organization, including a free assessment of your level of compliance applicable to your industry for IT and electronic asset disposition.\n# URL: https://eridirect.com/our-clients/industries/banking-finance\n# Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI)\nData center decommissioning, corporate IT asset refreshes, mobile devices, network equipment, serialized box programs, on-site shredding, asset resale and more – we know BFSI.\n Speak To An ERI Expert\n### The Challenge\nThe Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector encompasses commercial banks, credit unions, cooperatives, retail financial services, payment gateways, brokers, and other financial entities.\nIt is common for IT service providers to refer to the BFSI industry due to requirements that apply to all sectors. ERI does so for the same reason – data destruction requirements are effectively identical across all sectors of BFSI.\nAll BFSI organizations are mandated to comply with the myriad of data protection and disposal requirements including some combination of The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), The Fair and Accurate Credit & Transaction Act (FACTA), The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), other Federal regulations, as well as state laws including The California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) and New York 23 NYCRR 500.\nIn addition to regulatory compliance, the BFSI industry is built on trust. As BFSI organizations refresh IT hardware, decommission data centers, phone systems, mobile devices or replace ATM equipment, data can remain on those devices. Unless those devices are data sanitized or destroyed properly, customer and proprietary data may still be present, especially if ineffective means such as primitive physical destruction methods are used. This exposes the organization to the potential for a costly data breach and reputation damage.\nThe environmental issues are equally significant for every organization. E-waste only comprises 3% of the waste stream to landfills, yet accounts for 70% of the toxic substances found in landfills, including lead and mercury. Worse yet, much of the domestically generated e-waste is shipped to developing countries where it is processed unsafely exposing communities, especially children, to extremely high levels of hazardous substances. An institutional brand tied to discovery of its electronics in developing countries could be catastrophic.\n### Protect your Organization\nThe issue is twofold: A BFSI organization must meet the challenge of both protecting customer data contained in end-of-life equipment while also ensuring both data and non-data bearing electronics equipment are properly recycled to comply with all applicable regulations and to protect the reputation of the institution.\n**ERI is the largest fully integrated IT and electronics asset disposition service provider in the U.S. and focused on data destruction and cybersecurity** – ERI is the only company in the world with NAID AAA and e-Stewards certifications. NAID is the only recognized certification focused exclusively on data security and data destruction; e-Stewards addresses both data security and environmental controls. Holding these certifications means we are subject to audit more than our BFSI clients with 15 to 20 audits every year, including unannounced audits.\nBFSI clients need wide geographic coverage typically due to a wide geographic dispersion of locations. We can service clients throughout the country through our eight locations. Further, ERI can process more than typical IT assets such as ATMs, VOIP phone systems, and a wide range of mobile devices.\n**ERI specializes in BFSI** – Data center decommissioning, corporate IT asset refreshes, mobile devices, network equipment, serialized box programs, onsite shredding, asset resale and more – we know BFSI.\nWe 100% guarantee you and your customer’s data will be wiped from any IT and electronic assets if you use ERI. Further, there is a 100% guarantee that your assets won’t end up in a landfill anywhere in the world preventing public damage to your reputation.\nERI provides comprehensive data destruction and electronics recycling services with a defensible “audit trail.” This enables you to demonstrate compliance with all requirements for data destruction under the applicable FISMA, GLBA, FACTA, and PCI requirements as well as for environmental compliance.\n### Relied Upon by BFSI Clients in All Sectors\n# URL: https://eridirect.com/our-clients/industries/healthcare\n# Healthcare\nERI safeguards organizations, people and the environment by ensuring full compliance with all applicable regulations for healthcare organizations.\n Speak To An ERI Expert\n### The Challenge\nAll healthcare providers are mandated to comply with the myriad of both environmental and data protection requirements including The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH), The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), state and local laws, as well as possibly the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).\nHIPAA’s “Final Security Rule” requires the safeguarding and destruction of any Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) residing on legacy equipment or electronic health records (EHRs) being upgraded or taken out of service.\nAs healthcare organizations refresh hardware, equipment, and EHRs, ePHI can remain on a wide variety of devices including computers, mobile devices, copiers, printers, and imaging equipment. Unless those devices are data sanitized properly, ePHI may still be present, especially if ineffective means such as primitive physical destruction methods are used. This exposes the organization to the potential for a costly data breach and reputation damage.\nMost people responsible for healthcare compliance are aware of the healthcare provider that had 57 hard drives stolen from a storage closet resulting in a $1.5M HHS settlement and almost $17 million in costs to investigate, remediate, and achieve adequate controls. What if those hard drives were found in a landfill? Reused in a computer and resold without the data being sanitized completely? Would the cost impact be any different? The related facet of asset disposition is the responsible disposal of non-data bearing electronic devices such as pulse oximeters, glucose monitors, MRI equipment and televisions, as well as general e-waste.\nHowever, it is about more than just the potential civil and criminal penalties for improper disposal. The healthcare community should be especially concerned about recycling practices since e-waste only comprises 3% of the waste stream to landfills, yet accounts for 70% of the toxic substances found in landfills, including lead and mercury. Worse yet, much of the domestically generated e-waste is shipped to developing countries where it is processed unsafely exposing communities, especially children, to extremely high levels of hazardous substances.\n### Protect your Organization\nThe issue is twofold: An organization must meet the challenge of both protecting ePHI contained in end-of-life equipment while also ensuring both data and non-data bearing electronics equipment is properly recycled to comply with all applicable regulations and to protect the reputation of the organization.\nERI safeguards organizations, people and the environment by ensuring full compliance with all applicable regulations for healthcare organizations. As the largest fully integrated IT and electronic asset disposition provider in the United States, we have a nationwide solution while maintaining the highest certifications for both data destruction (NAID) and responsible recycling at all our facilities.\nERI provides comprehensive data destruction and electronics recycling services with a defensible “audit trail.” This enables organizations to demonstrate compliance with all requirements for data destruction under the applicable healthcare regulations as well as for environmental compliance.\nChoosing ERI is the best way to safeguard your organization for IT and electronic asset disposition.

These batteries are used to power many everyday devices from remote controls and flashlights, to smoke detectors and children’s toys, and various other household items. With the widespread usages of Alkaline batteries comes the responsibility to make sure that they are disposed of and recycled properly.\nStrategically located at ERI’s Indiana facility, ERI has the capacity to **process in-house millions of pounds of alkaline batteries per year.** Our recycling process breaks the battery down into it’s raw components — **steel, brass, paper and black mass** — and through our strategic and vetted downstream partners, we’re able to **recycle 100% of the battery.** ERI collects batteries nationwide at all our facilities for in-house recycling and processing and can receive batteries mixed or pre-sorted.\nUnlike rechargeable batteries, alkaline batteries are typically a single-use product. Meaning that once they run out of energy, they are often thrown away and end up in landfills, where they contribute to environmental pollution. Taking steps to properly recycle alkaline batteries not only prevents hazardous materials from seeping into the soil and water but also allows for the recovery of metals and other valuable materials that can be reused in the manufacturing process.\nERI services are designed around the safe recovery, transportation and processing of alkaline and all types of batteries. These services include:\n  * End of life management services are designed for the recovery and handling of equipment and for the removal and recovery of batteries.\n  * Battery bins for collection of devices with batteries in offices, retail spaces, apartment buildings, and more to ensure proper collection and storage of devices with batteries.\n  * Manufacturer product recalls involving devices with batteries to develop retrieval methods are designed with the customer and our compliance team to ensure safe recovery of devices.\nRecycling alkaline batteries is a small but impactful way to protect our environment.

Packaging and logistics service and is available for both small and large quantity pickups. With the WGS service, ERI will package, palletize, shrink wrap and provide padded pick-up service if desired. Material is transported to the nearest ERI facility for in-house processing.\nAssets are picked up when scheduled through ERI’s robust tracking and asset management portal, Optech™.\nIn addition to our own transportation fleet, ERI uses third-party logistics and asset-based carriers nationwide. ERI will track each driver through the DOT’s “SAFER” (Safety and Fitness Electronic Records) system, which tracks all carriers’ accidents, mechanical failures, highway scale inspection results, and drug testing for operators. When possible, ERI uses carriers who are SmartWay Certified, which is a certification showing that the carrier has taken sufficient steps and provided evidence in efforts to reduce their overall carbon footprint. Our third-party logistics do the same rigorous background and security checks during the on-boarding steps process as ERI.\n###  Trailer Staging\nERI recognizes that some clients have limited space for the storage and consolidation of electronic devices. One of the many solutions ERI offers is the placement of a trailer in which electronics can be consolidated for shipment.\nERI can stage a trailer at the client’s choice of location where the client can load properly packaged electronics into the trailer. When the trailer is full, ERI can remove the full trailer from the site and replace with an empty trailer to provide seamless collection of electronics for recycling.\n Contact An ERI Expert\n# URL: https://eridirect.com/services/on-site-shredding\n# On-Site Shredding\nInstead of sending IT assets to ERI’s facility, clients can request that one of our secure electronic destruction vehicles come to their location.\n Speak To An ERI Expert\nMany clients prefer or require having their IT assets destroyed on-site as opposed to sending them to our facility for destruction. Fortunately, this is possible thanks to ERI’s fleet of electronic destruction vehicles.\n###  **How On-Site Shredding Works**\nInstead of sending IT assets to ERI’s facility, clients can request that one of our secure electronic destruction vehicles come to their location. These vehicles are equipped to handle the destruction of hard drives, cell phones, computers, tapes, CDs, and other electronic equipment.\nERI can also provide clients with a secure data bin that can be used to collect any assets that need to be destroyed. The steel-plated bin can be locked to keep all of the assets safe until our destruction vehicle arrives.\nOnce we arrive, the IT assets will be taken inside the truck, where our professionals will be counted or serialized. The serial numbers on each device will be recorded before the device is shredded. This allows clients to keep track of their assets even after they have been destroyed. Clients will also receive certificates of destruction for each IT asset so they have a record of everything that has been destroyed.\nSince the assets are destroyed inside the vehicle, clients can have keep a watchful eye on their assets throughout the process to ensure the destruction is done properly. After the process is complete, the shredded materials will be transported to an ERI facility. Our team will then remove aluminum, glass, metals and other recyclables from the shredded materials.\n###  **The Security of On-Site Shredding**\nMany clients worry that the data on their IT assets will somehow be compromised while the assets are being transported to a recycler for destruction. With on-site shredding, this should no longer be a concern since the assets are not moved from the client’s location until they are destroyed.\nThe process that is used to shred IT assets within our vehicles meets or surpasses all U.S. government standards related to the destruction of sensitive data and IT assets. It also surpasses the data destruction standards established by the Department of Defense and the National Institute For Standards and Technology. Therefore, there’s no need to worry that the data will be compromised or retrievable after the device has been destroyed.\nIn addition, all of ERI’s employees have been thoroughly trained to handle sensitive data. Each employee also has to pass rigorous background checks before they are hired at one of our facilities. The trustworthiness of our employees combined with our innovative destruction process should put our clients’ minds at ease about the security of their sensitive data.\n###  **On-Site Shredding is Safe For the Environment**\nDestroying old IT assets through on-site shredding is also environmentally friendly. Unlike other e-waste recyclers, we do not use harmful chemicals at any point in the data destruction or shredding process. As a result, shredding IT assets inside our trucks is not harmful to the environment or people. The shredded materials are also completely recyclable, which means nothing that is shredded in our vehicles will end up sitting in a landfill.\n###  **On-Site Data Erasure Services**\nERI also offers several on-site data erasure services that may be of interest to our clients. First, clients can request that our team erase data on their devices. The device would remain in the client’s possession after the data has been erased so it can be reused internally or resold. ERI also offers data erasure services for employees who are working remotely. A bootable USB drive can be created that gives the remote employee the power to wipe the hard drive on their own. The USB drive will automatically create a detailed report that outlines each drive that the remote employee has destroyed. Once this report is retrieved, ERI will be able to provide a certificate of data destruction to the client.\nFor more information on our on-site shredding, contact ERI at 1-800-ERI-DIRECT or request a quote by filling out the form on our website.\n Contact An ERI Expert\n###  Services\n### IT and Electronics Asset Disposition (ITAD) ERI is able to securely and responsibly process IT assets to be retired or re-used by an organization.\n### Data Center Decommissioning ERI is able to process your data center’s assets while ensuring data destruction and reducing the environmental impact.\n### Data Destruction ERI guarantees the destruction of all data via on-site or off-site destruction methods.\n### Electronics Recycling ERI processes 300 million pounds of electronic waste annually.\n### Remarketing ERI can identify, sanitize, test, refurbish and resell each device.\n### Logistics National and international logistics support through several services to meet an organization’s needs.\n### Recycling Kits The most comprehensive electronics mail back program available with 19 different box types.\n### Specialty Programs ERI can design and implement a wide range of custom initiatives.\n### The ERI Advantage\nLearn more about ERI by clicking on each advantage below.\n  * ####   100% Guaranteed Data Destruction\nERI wipes devices in accordance with Department of Defense (DOD) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards before being sent to its state-of-the-art e-waste shredders.

Such events can be disastrous to your reputation and can result in your organization incurring fines or potentially the additional cost of disposal or cleanup. Those are not just theoretical outcomes – some of the most prestigious companies in the world have had to incur significant additional cost and scramble to address a large provider’s bankruptcy in 2018; well-known organizations have had their brand tied to scandals involving exporting e-waste to developing countries; and numerous local governments are currently embroiled in litigation over clean-up costs from abandoned e-waste by disreputable recyclers. Are any of those risks worth saving a few pennies per pound on electronics recycling?\nThe following resources are provided to allow you to verify that we are who we say we are and to make an informed decision regarding other providers.\nMake sure your current or future service provider is not one called out in the Basel Action Network (BAN) “Scam Recycling” reports for exporting to developing nations.\nVerify a provider’s e-Stewards certification.\nThere is a big difference between being a NAID organization member and going through the rigorous process to become NAID AAA certified.
