##  What does it mean to be R2 certified?
Key aspects of R2 certification include: [3]   
* **Environmental Management System:** Implementing a system to manage air emissions, water discharges, and waste. [5]   
* **Worker Health and Safety:** Ensuring a safe working environment with proper training and protective equipment. [5]   
* **Data Security:** Implementing measures to protect data stored on electronic devices, including secure data destruction. [5]   
* **Prioritizing Reuse and Recycling:** R2 certified recyclers must prioritize reuse and recycling before considering disposal options. [5, 6]   
* **Downstream Management:** Ensuring that any vendors involved in the recycling chain also adhere to responsible practices. [5, 6]   
* **Independent Audits:** R2 certification requires regular audits by an independent third-party to verify compliance. [5]   
R2 certification is a voluntary program, but it is widely recognized and can help organizations demonstrate their commitment to responsible electronics recycling. It is also often a requirement for organizations looking to responsibly manage their electronic waste and ensure data security. [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9]
