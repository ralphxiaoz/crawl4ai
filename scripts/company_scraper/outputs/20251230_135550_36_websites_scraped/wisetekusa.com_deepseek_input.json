Here are the 10 reasons to change colocation providers. June 28, 2023\nPremium WhitepaperHow to build a global data center strategy Read our eBook to understand the 7 considerations when building a global data center strategy August 31, 2021\n## Frequently asked questions\nWhat is a data center?\nA data center is a specialized facility that houses computer systems, servers, storage, and networking equipment in a controlled environment optimized for performance and reliability. Data centers provide the necessary power, cooling, physical security, and connectivity infrastructure to keep digital operations running 24x7x365. Modern data centers range from small server rooms to massive hyperscale facilities spanning hundreds of thousands of square feet.\nWhat's the difference between hyperscale and retail colocation?\nRetail colocation involves smaller deployments, such as renting individual racks or cages in a shared facility, while hyperscale data centers involve larger deployments, including the leasing of entire data halls and buildings with megawatts of custom infrastructure. Retail colocation is like renting an apartment; hyperscale is like building or leasing a custom warehouse.\nWhat makes a data center AI-ready?\nAI-ready data centers are specifically designed to handle the intensive computational requirements of artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads. Key features include high-density power infrastructure capable of supporting power-hungry GPU clusters and AI processors, advanced cooling systems that utilize liquid cooling to manage the significant heat generated by AI hardware, ultra-low latency network connectivity for real-time AI applications, and a flexible infrastructure that can quickly scale to accommodate rapidly evolving AI technologies. AI-ready facilities also maintain the same stringent security and compliance standards required for sensitive AI model training and deployment.\nWhy should companies leverage a data center instead of staying on-premises?\nUsing a professional data center offers numerous advantages over on-premises deployments, including: enhanced physical security with 24x7 monitoring; reliable power infrastructure with backup systems; professional cooling systems optimized for IT equipment; access to multiple network carriers for redundant connectivity; compliance with industry standards and regulations; scalability to grow as business needs change; and reduced capital expenditure by leveraging shared infrastructure rather than building your own facility.\nWhat is a hyperscale data center?\nHyperscale data centers are massive facilities designed to efficiently support extensive cloud computing and big data storage needs. These facilities span between 100,000 to over 1,000,000 square feet and consume 20 to 150+ megawatts of power. They house between 100,000 to 500,000+ servers while maximizing space efficiency through high-density configurations, with individual racks drawing 10-150 kW or more of power. Hyperscale data centers are built to accommodate the massive infrastructure requirements of major cloud providers, internet companies, and large enterprises that need to deploy thousands of servers at scale with maximum efficiency and reliability.\nHow should I choose a data center?\nWhen selecting a data center provider, consider: geographic location and proximity to your business operations; physical security measures and compliance certifications; power capacity, redundancy, and reliability (including backup systems); cooling infrastructure and efficiency; available connectivity options and carrier diversity; scalability to accommodate future growth; sustainability practices and renewable energy usage; technical support availability and expertise; and the provider's financial stability and track record of reliability.\n## Contact us\nFill out this form and an Iron Mountain data center specialist will contact you shortly.\nGet in touch\n### IMDC Portal\nLog in to your IMDC portal account to create or view your tickets.\n### Email us\nIf you would like to get in touch with us directly, please contact us at datacenters@ironmountain.com\nReach out\n### Call us\nDial 1-833-IRM-COLO today for all inquiries including sales, support, marketing and more.\n[1-833-IRM-COLO](tel://18334762656)\n# URL: https://www.ironmountain.com/data-centers/locations\n# Data centers locations\n30+ Locations. 3 Continents. 5M+ Gross SF.

This method supports your data privacy compliance obligations by safeguarding critical information from unauthorized encryption or exfiltration. It reinforces your overall security posture against sophisticated cyber attacks.\nHow does Iron Mountain help businesses recover after a ransomware attack?\nIron Mountain provides a comprehensive end to end data protection service to ensure you can recover your data after a ransomware attack. Our service focuses on restoring your systems using a clean, validated copy of your data that has been stored in an offsite, logically air-gapped Iron Cloud data center.\n  * The recovery process starts with your data, which is held in our secure, air-gapped vaults , preventing data corruption and/or data loss.\n  * We assist in validating the recovery data to confirm it is uninfected before it is used to restore your servers and bring systems back online.\n  * Our experienced support teams provide expert guidance throughout the entire server recovery process, supplementing your internal IT resources during a critical event.\nOur primary objective extends beyond simple restoration to building long-term cyber security resilience. The methodology for recovering a server after a ransomware attack is a vital part of a broader data protection strategy. We provide the tools and expertise to help your business withstand and recover from sophisticated cyber threats. This strengthens your ability to maintain business continuity during and after a critical incident.\nWhy should I choose Iron Mountain for ransomware recovery as a service?\nChoosing Iron Mountain for ransomware recovery as a service provides access to specialized infrastructure and deep expertise in data protection. We assist with the complexities of cyber recovery so your team can focus on core business activities. Our services are designed to offer a reliable and predictable path to recovery. This helps your organisation avoid the uncertainty and high costs associated with a ransomware incident.\n  * Our service includes delivery of the on premise software and hardware to ensure you have a local, immutable backup as well as our cloud managed service to ensure you have secure and recoverable copy from our cloud environment.\n  * Our zero trust data protection solution also helps prevent attacks via features such as encryption and anomaly detection and can identify where and when an attack began should you experience a breach.\n  * We offer a clear cost structure for a complete data protection solution, helping you manage budgets and prevent the unforeseen expenses of an attack.\n  * Our strict chain-of-custody procedures and support for data privacy compliance standards give you an auditable trail of your data's security.\nPartnering with us means investing in a strategic approach to cyber resilience. Our Cyber Recovery as a Service is a critical component of a robust business continuity plan. We integrate core privacy and security principles to protect your information assets. This provides a defensible and predictable recovery strategy that safeguards your most valuable data from sophisticated threats, helping to preserve your company's reputation and financial stability.\nWhat is cyber recovery?\nCyber recovery is a specialized component of a company's business continuity plan that focuses on recovering from a destructive cyber attack, such as ransomware. Its main purpose is to protect critical data by isolating it in a highly secure, vaulted environment. This makes the data inaccessible to attackers. It assumes a breach will occur and prepares the organisation to restore operations from a trusted, uncompromised data source.\n  * The process involves creating immutable and air-gapped copies of essential data, meaning the copies cannot be altered, encrypted, or deleted by network-based threats.\n  * A critical step is the validation of recovery data integrity, which helps to confirm that the data is clean and malware-free before it is used for restoration.\n  * A successful cyber recovery strategy allows an organization to rapidly restore systems and data to a known good state, which helps minimize downtime and data loss.\nA well-designed cyber recovery plan is essential for achieving modern cyber security resilience. This proactive approach, often guided by information governance advisory services, is critical for maintaining business operations and preserving customer trust. It goes beyond traditional backups by preparing a business to respond to and recover from an attack with confidence, protecting the organisation's reputation in the event of a significant cyber incident.\nCan you recover from a ransomware attack without paying the ransom?\nYes, recovering from a ransomware attack without paying the ransom is achievable with a proper cyber recovery plan. The ability to do so depends on having clean, isolated, and immutable backups of your critical data and applications. A proactive data protection strategy is the most effective way to counter these threats. It shifts an organization's position from being a victim to being prepared for a recovery event.\n  * An effective recovery depends on secure, offsite solutions like Iron Cloud Cyber Recovery as a Service that include logically air-gapped data protection, meaning that backup data is physically and logically disconnected from the production network.\n  * The recovery plan must include processes to identify ransomware and completely remove ransomware from all affected systems before restoring any data from a clean source.\n  * Regularly testing your data restoration procedures is vital to confirm that your backups are viable and that your response team is prepared to execute the recovery plan.\nUltimately, the capacity to recover is the direct result of a robust data protection solution. This approach builds the cyber resilience needed to withstand an attack and protect data privacy. By investing in a comprehensive strategy before an incident occurs, a business can confidently restore its operations, maintain data integrity, and avoid the significant financial and reputational costs associated with paying a ransom.\nHow can a business minimize downtime and data loss from a ransomware event?\nTo minimize downtime and data loss, a business must combine proactive data protection measures with a rapid response plan. The central principle is having a clean, verified copy of data, particularly for vital records storage, in a secure, isolated location. This preparation allows for immediate restoration activities to begin as soon as the production environment is secured, reducing the overall impact on operations and protecting your most critical information.\n  * Implement automated backups to a secure, air-gapped location to create a logical and physical barrier between your recovery data and network-based threats.\n  * Develop a clear, tested incident response plan that specifies the actions required for recovering a server after a ransomware attack has been identified.\n  * Consider using contract services from a third-party provider (3PP) that specializes in cyber recovery to gain access to expert support and advanced infrastructure.\nA well-executed data protection strategy is fundamental to business continuity and achieving cyber security resilience. By preparing for a worst-case scenario, an organisation can significantly reduce the operational and financial impact of an attack. This preparation helps to protect revenue, reputation, and customer trust. It enables the business to get its operations back online quickly and securely following a disruptive event.\nWhat is the difference between data security and data privacy?\nData security and data privacy are related but separate disciplines within a data protection strategy. Data security refers to the technical controls and protective measures used to defend data against unauthorized access and theft. It focuses on preventing breaches from external threats and internal misuse. In essence, it is the framework of tools and policies that guard your information and infrastructure.\n  * Data security measures include technologies like encryption, network firewalls, access controls, and secure backup solutions designed to safeguard data integrity.\n  * Data privacy, on the other hand, governs how personal data is collected, processed, stored, and shared, defining the rights of individuals over their own information.\n  * Achieving data privacy compliance means adhering to regulations like GDPR and CCPA, which set strict rules for handling personally identifiable information.\nA complete data protection strategy, often managed through a central Policy Center, must address both privacy and security. It is possible to have strong data security measures in place without adhering to data privacy principles. However, data privacy cannot be achieved without strong data security. For example, protecting data from a ransomware attack is a security function, while managing customer information according to legal standards is a privacy function.\n## We're here to help.\nGet a quote\n### Login and bill pay\n### Support center\nGet support\n### Call sales\n[800 - 899 - 4766](tel://+18008994766)\n# URL: https://www.ironmountain.com/services/it-asset-lifecycle-management\n# Asset lifecycle management (ALM)\nSecure, sustainable hardware asset management and IT asset disposition\n## IT asset lifecycle management (ALM)\n  * Data center decommissioning\n  * ITAD for corporate end-user devices\n  * Hardware asset management\nJump To:\n  * IT asset lifecycle management (ALM)\n    * Data center decommissioning\n    * ITAD for corporate end-user devices\n    * Hardware asset management\n  * Available Services\n  * Data Security\n  * Sustainability\n  * Value Recovery\n  * Certifications\nis now Iron Mountain\nis now Iron Mountain\n## Iron Mountain has acquired Premier Surplus, Inc.\nIron Mountain has successfully acquired Premier Surplus, Inc., a regional leader in IT asset disposition (ITAD) and IT asset remarketing, established in 2001 in Dawsonville, GA.

This framework provides visibility and control over the entire IT asset lifecycle. A successful lifecycle management solution enables technology resources to be utilized efficiently and disposed of securely. It transforms IT hardware from a simple operational expense into a managed portfolio of assets with measurable value and risk profiles.\nA complete ALM program includes several distinct stages.\n  * The cycle begins with asset procurement and deployment, where technology is purchased and integrated into the business environment for employee use.\n  * The maintenance phase involves managing, upgrading, and servicing assets during their operational life to maximize their utility and performance.\n  * The final retirement stage consists of securely removing assets from service, destroying all data, and reselling or recycling the hardware responsibly.\nAn effective asset life cycle planning strategy is essential for modern business. It directly impacts financial performance by optimizing technology spend and preventing unnecessary purchases. It also forms a critical part of a company's security posture by ensuring sensitive data is not exposed on retired equipment..\n## Additional resources\n Solution GuidesSecure ITAD eBook Iron Mountain’s ITAD program offers IT departments a secure and consistent solution for managing IT asset disposition.

This provides a framework for legal and ethical ITAD. Our teams are trained to handle a wide range of IT equipment, from servers and laptops to mobile devices and storage arrays.

We provide a secure and sustainable solution for managing your electronic waste.

By partnering with us for your e-waste needs, you can be confident that your end-of-life assets are managed ethically. This commitment gives you confidence that your ITAD program meets the most stringent environmental and regulatory requirements.\nWhat are the essential steps for a legal and ethical ITAD program?\nA successful program for IT asset disposition (ITAD) requires a structured approach to protect data while remaining environmentally compliant.The first step is creating a clear policy for end-of-life asset management.\nThis policy should define processes for inventory tracking, data destruction, and choosing a certified ITAD partner. A well-defined program mitigates legal risks. It also protects brand reputation and helps all stakeholders understand their responsibilities when equipment is retired.\n  * Establish a secure chain of custody from the moment an asset is taken offline to its final disposition, with detailed tracking records to prevent loss or theft of devices or data.\n  * Implement data destruction processes that are compliant with standards like NIST 800-88, ensuring all data is rendered unrecoverable before an asset is remarketed or recycled.\n  * Partner with an IT asset disposition provider who offers transparent reporting and a final Certificate of Destruction, providing an auditable trail that verifies compliance with data privacy and environmental laws.\nSelecting an ITAD partner that is certified to standards like R2 or e-Stewards is critical. These certifications confirm that e-waste recycling is handled responsibly. This prevents electronic waste disposal from contributing to environmental harm.\nHow should a business manage electronic waste disposal?\nProper management of electronic waste is a critical business responsibility. Companies must look beyond simple disposal. They should adopt comprehensive e-waste services that prioritize both data security and environmental protection through circular practices.\nAn effective strategy begins with identifying all retired IT assets that constitute e-waste. This includes everything from laptops and servers to monitors and mobile devices. A formal process prevents any device from being overlooked and handled incorrectly at its end of life.\n  * An experienced ITAD partner will segregate assets intended for e-waste recycling from those that may have resale value through IT asset remarketing, allowing you to maximize recovery while ensuring proper disposal for non-working or obsolete equipment.\n  * Verify that your chosen e-waste partner provides secure logistics, including scheduled e-waste pickup and transportation in sealed, GPS-tracked vehicles to prevent asset loss during transit.\n  * Verify that the disposal provider provides documentation detailing the recycling process for all materials, from plastics and metals to hazardous components like batteries.\nThe ultimate goal is to responsibly dispose of equipment while protecting your organization from liability. This includes ensuring complete data destruction on all data-bearing devices before they enter the recycling stream. Choosing a certified partner for technology recycling helps you meet all legal and ethical obligations related to electronic waste.\nWhat are the differences between IT asset recycling and IT asset remarketing?\nIT asset recycling and remarketing are two distinct paths within an ITAD program. Both are crucial for effective end-of-life asset management. The primary difference lies in the final destination of the equipment.\nThe decision between these options is typically based on the asset's age, condition, and potential market value. A comprehensive ITAD strategy should incorporate both to maximize financial return and maintain environmental responsibility for all retired assets.\n  * IT asset remarketing involves securely sanitizing, refurbishing, and reselling functional equipment to recover residual value, turning retired technology into a revenue stream for your business.\n  * IT asset recycling is the process for non-functional or obsolete equipment; it involves dismantling devices and responsibly recovering raw materials like metals, plastics, and glass for reuse in manufacturing.\n  * Both processes must begin with certified data destruction to eliminate sensitive information and prevent any corporate data from leaving your control, regardless of the asset's final path.\nEffective asset disposition requires robust tracking and documentation for either path. Detailed reporting and inventory management allows you to see which assets were sold and for how much, and which were recycled according to compliance standards. This transparency is key for auditing purposes. Ultimately, a balanced approach allows a company to meet its financial goals and corporate sustainability targets simultaneously. This creates a responsible and efficient disposition cycle.\nWhy is a Certificate of Destruction necessary for IT equipment disposal?\nA Certificate of Destruction is a critical document in the IT asset disposition process. It serves as official, legally defensible proof that the data on your company’s IT assets has been permanently destroyed.\nThis certificate is not just a receipt; it is a vital component of risk management and regulatory compliance. It provides auditors and stakeholders with tangible evidence that your organization followed secure procedures for data destruction and electronic waste disposal.\n  * The certificate provides an auditable record that ties specific assets, identified by serial number, to a confirmed date and method of destruction, which is essential for compliance with data privacy laws.\n  * This document is crucial for demonstrating adherence to internal governance policies and industry regulations, proving that your company takes data security and end-of-life asset management seriously.\nWhen dealing with high volumes of media, such as hard drives or backup tapes, secure destruction is paramount. Ultimately, this Certificate of Destruction documentation is indispensable. It closes the loop on the asset lifecycle. It also provides the necessary assurance that your company’s legal and ethical ITAD obligations have been fully met.\nDoes Iron Mountain offer Secure IT Asset Disposition services globally?\nYes, we provide secure IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) services across the globe.
