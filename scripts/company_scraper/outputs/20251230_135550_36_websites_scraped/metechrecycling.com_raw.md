# How To Safely Recycle Lithium Batteries
## The World Runs on Batteries
Lithium batteries power everything – including cell phones, laptops, toys, appliances, power tools, and electric toothbrushes. High-tech devices usually contain rechargeable lithium-ion batteries because it is much more convenient to charge a device than it is to frequently dismantle it and replace a standard alkaline disposable battery (commonly used in basic devices like tv remotes or flashlights). Lithium-ion batteries last much longer and have higher power density than traditional batteries.
### What’s in a Lithium Battery?
Lithium batteries are composed of various elements, including lithium-ion or lithium-polymer cells, a protective casing, electrolytes, and valuable metals like cobalt, nickel, and copper. Despite being rechargeable, they will eventually require replacement due to a loss of capacity. You should NOT dispose of them in regular trash or recycling bins, because they contain harmful substances that could be hazardous to the environment if released.
### Types of Lithium Batteries
There are several different types of lithium batteries, each with its own unique composition and applications.
**Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LiCoO2 or LCO)**
This is the most common type of lithium-ion battery and is used in many consumer electronics like laptops, smartphones, and digital cameras. They offer high energy density, providing long-lasting power.
**Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4 or LFP)**
These batteries are known for their excellent thermal stability and safety characteristics, which is why they are used in devices like electric vehicles, electric bikes, and storage systems for renewable energy. LiFePO4 batteries have a longer cycle life and can withstand high charge and discharge rates.
**Lithium Manganese Oxide (LiMn2O4 or LMO)**
LMO batteries are commonly found in power tools, medical devices, and electric bikes. They can deliver high currents and have a relatively long cycle life.
**Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (LiNiMnCoO2 or NMC)**
NMC batteries are a popular choice for electric vehicles and energy storage applications. They offer a good balance between high energy density and power output.
**Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminum Oxide (LiNiCoAlO2 or NCA)**
NCA batteries are also used in electric vehicles, and have similar advantages to NMC batteries.
**Lithium Titanate (Li4Ti5O12 or LTO)**
LTO batteries are known for their extremely fast charge and discharge rates, which makes them helpful for quick-charging electric buses and energy storage systems. They have a long cycle life and great thermal stability.
### ![](https://www.metechrecycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lithium_Battery-800.jpg)
### Why is it Important to Recycle Lithium Batteries?
Recycling is critical for conservation of natural resources, minimizing waste, and preventing pollution. By reusing materials from recycled products like valuable metals and minerals, we reduce the need for extracting and processing virgin resources from the earth. This helps conserve natural habitats and minimizes the impact of resource extraction on ecosystems. Recycling lithium batteries also diverts waste from landfills, reducing the rapidly growing need for new landfill sites and keeping harmful substances from entering the environment.
### How Does It Work?
The process of recycling lithium batteries involves several steps to carefully ensure the proper recovery of materials. First, batteries must be separated from regular waste streams. After collection, batteries are sorted based on their types to facilitate efficient processing. The batteries are then dismantled to access the cells inside. Battery cells are the basic building block of a battery that generates electrical energy through chemical reactions. Shredding, sieving, and magnetic separation is then done to sort metallic components from the battery cells. These components undergo further processing to extract valuable metals. Remaining components, including plastics, are then disposed of responsibly.
### Dangers of Improper Lithium Battery Disposal
Lithium batteries contain a sheet that separates electrodes and prevents short-circuiting. If a battery is crushed or punctured in any way, the separator could be breached causing a thermal reaction – leading to a spark or fire. If the compromised battery is near any flammable material or there are a bunch of batteries together (say in a landfill or a recycling center) it could be a recipe for disaster. In recent years, there have been many [lithium ion battery fires](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/09/tech/lithium-ion-battery-fires/index.html) due to malfunction or improper handling.
Lithium is highly reactive: temperature, charging voltage, and casing damage can cause a thermal reaction. That’s why airline passengers are recommended to keep laptops and cell phones in their carry-on bags, and [prohibited from checking spare lithium batteries and e-cigarettes in luggage](https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/lithium-batteries-baggage#:~:text=Spare%20\(uninstalled\)%20lithium%20metal%20batteries,passenger%20in%20carry%2Don%20baggage.). Proper handling is ALWAYS required to prevent fire and pollution risk while recycling lithium batteries.

# Solar BESS Decommissioning: Safety, Compliance, and Recycling
As solar projects continue to scale across utility, commercial, and community environments, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) have become an essential component of modern [solar infrastructure.](https://www.metechrecycling.com/solar-panel-recycling/) By storing excess generation for use at peak demand, BESS technology increases system resilience, improves grid stability, and maximizes solar ROI.
But just like PV panels and inverters, a BESS eventually reaches the end of its usable life. Whether due to capacity degradation, safety concerns, or system upgrades, **proper end-of-life planning is crucial for solar developers, EPCs, asset owners, and O &M teams.**
[METech Recycling](https://www.metechrecycling.com/) specializes in safe, compliant, and sustainable BESS decommissioning for solar sites of any scale.
* * *
## **1. Why BESS End-of-Life Planning Matters for Solar Projects**
A BESS is composed of battery modules, inverters, thermal management systems, wiring, and enclosures—all of which require careful handling at end-of-life.
For solar operators, failure to plan ahead can lead to:
  * **Safety risks** from high-voltage lithium-ion components
  * **Fire hazards** associated with thermal runaway
  * **Regulatory non-compliance** during hazardous-material transport
  * **Environmental impact** from improper disposal of lithium, cobalt, and nickel
  * **Lost revenue** by overlooking second-life or material recovery opportunities


Integrating BESS decommissioning into the solar lifecycle protects your project, your personnel, and your investment.
* * *
## **2. The BESS Decommissioning Process for Solar Sites**
METech simplifies the technical, regulatory, and logistical challenges involved in retiring energy storage systems from solar farms.
### **a. Planning & Risk Assessment**
  * Document system capacity (MW/MWh), site layout, and component details
  * Create a solar-specific Decommissioning Plan
  * Conduct hazard assessments
  * Ensure compliance with EPA, DOT, and local AHJ rules
  * Prepare chain-of-custody documentation


### **b. De-Energize & Disconnect**
  * Safely discharge and electrically isolate all battery units
  * Disconnect DC-coupled or AC-coupled solar tie-ins
  * Follow strict LOTO (lock-out/tag-out) procedures


### **c. Removal & Transport**
  * Dismantle racks, containers, and wiring
  * Package lithium batteries to Class 9 hazmat standards
  * Coordinate nationwide transport to METech’s R2v3-certified facilities


### **d. Second-Life Evaluation & Recycling**
  * Test modules for remaining capacity (possible use: microgrids, backup storage)
  * Recycle non-viable modules to recover lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper
  * Process auxiliary solar equipment such as inverters, transformers, and BOS gear


### **e. Site Restoration**
  * Remove remaining structures and storage enclosures
  * Clear concrete or metal foundations as required
  * Provide full reporting for environmental and ESG documentation


* * *
## **3. Second Life vs. Recycling for Solar BESS**
### **Second Life Applications**
Battery modules with usable capacity can be repurposed into:
  * Backup systems for ag facilities
  * Community microgrids
  * Off-grid storage for low-demand sites


This supports both sustainability and cost efficiency in the solar ecosystem.
### **Responsible Recycling**
When reuse isn’t viable, METech ensures:
  * Full recovery of metals (lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper)
  * Proper processing of plastics, wiring, and metals
  * Zero landfill for hazardous components


Our R2v3-certified processes ensure all materials are handled safely and responsibly.
* * *
## **4. Compliance Requirements for Solar BESS**
End-of-life energy storage is regulated under multiple frameworks, including:
  * **EPA hazardous waste regulations**
  * **DOT hazmat transport rules**
  * **Fire code requirements (NFPA 855, IFC)**
  * **Local environmental permits**
  * **ESG and sustainability reporting for investors**
  * **Decommissioning bonds and closure plans for utility-scale assets**


Working with a certified recycling partner keeps solar operators fully compliant from removal to material recovery.
* * *
## **5. Why Solar Developers Choose METech Recycling**
With over 50 years of industry experience and deep solar-sector expertise, METech offers:
  * **Turnkey BESS decommissioning** from planning to final recycling
  * **Specialized handling of lithium-ion systems** and energy-storage hazards
  * **R2v3-certified recycling** for batteries, inverters, wiring, and BOS components
  * **Nationwide logistics capabilities** for utility-scale solar sites
  * **Detailed chain-of-custody and destruction documentation**
  * **ESG-aligned reporting** for sustainability metrics
  * **A minority-owned, inclusive organization committed to environmental stewardship**


Whether your project is 5 MW or 500 MW, METech ensures a safe, efficient, and compliant lifecycle closure.
* * *
## **6. Take the Next Step: Plan Your Solar BESS Decommissioning**
End-of-life doesn’t have to mean end of value.
METech helps solar developers, EPCs, and asset owners:
  * Assess system condition and recycling options
  * Estimate decommissioning cost and recovery potential
  * Build compliant end-of-life programs
  * Create documentation for permitting and ESG reporting

## [How To Safely Recycle Lithium Batteries](https://www.metechrecycling.com/2023/06/30/how-to-safely-recycle-lithium-batteries/)
The World Runs on Batteries Lithium batteries power everything - including cell phones, laptops, toys, appliances, power tools, and electric toothbrushes. High-tech devices usually contain rechargeable lithium-ion batteries because it is much more convenient to charge a device than it is to frequently dismantle it and replace a standard alkaline disposable battery (commonly used in basic devices like tv remotes or flashlights). Lithium-ion batteries last much longer and have higher power density than traditional batteries. What’s in a Lithium Battery? Lithium batteries are composed of various elements, including lithium-ion or lithium-polymer cells, a protective casing, electrolytes, and valuable metals [...]

## [What Happens When Solar Panels Are Thrown Away?](https://www.metechrecycling.com/2025/07/10/what-happens-when-solar-panels-are-thrown-away/)
The solar industry is booming. Across rooftops, deserts, and fields, panels are being installed at record pace to meet ambitious renewable energy goals. But there’s a challenge the industry is only beginning to face: what happens when these panels stop producing power? Solar panels typically last 20–30 years, meaning the first generation of large-scale installations is already approaching retirement. By the 2030s, millions of tons of solar panels will reach end-of-life each year. Without a plan, many of them risk ending up in landfills or being processed by unregulated facilities that don’t properly handle the materials inside. This is the [...]

The artificial intelligence boom is redefining what it means to scale in today’s digital world. As AI workloads intensify, data centers are rapidly expanding their compute capacity—deploying high-performance GPUs, upgrading server clusters, and redesigning infrastructure for real-time data processing. But this rush toward innovation has a lesser-known byproduct: a mounting wave of retired IT hardware. For every rack of new AI-optimized equipment installed, there’s an older generation of servers, switches, and storage systems ready to be decommissioned. And without a responsible IT asset disposition (ITAD) strategy in place, that hardware becomes both an environmental liability and a security risk. At [...]

## [Solar BESS Decommissioning: Safety, Compliance, and Recycling](https://www.metechrecycling.com/2025/11/20/solar-bess-battery-energy-storage-system-recycling/)
As solar projects continue to scale across utility, commercial, and community environments, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) have become an essential component of modern solar infrastructure. By storing excess generation for use at peak demand, BESS technology increases system resilience, improves grid stability, and maximizes solar ROI. But just like PV panels and inverters, a BESS eventually reaches the end of its usable life. Whether due to capacity degradation, safety concerns, or system upgrades, proper end-of-life planning is crucial for solar developers, EPCs, asset owners, and O&M teams.

## [How To Safely Recycle Lithium Batteries](https://www.metechrecycling.com/2023/06/30/how-to-safely-recycle-lithium-batteries/)
The World Runs on Batteries Lithium batteries power everything - including cell phones, laptops, toys, appliances, power tools, and electric toothbrushes. High-tech devices usually contain rechargeable lithium-ion batteries because it is much more convenient to charge a device than it is to frequently dismantle it and replace a standard alkaline disposable battery (commonly used in basic devices like tv remotes or flashlights). Lithium-ion batteries last much longer and have higher power density than traditional batteries. What’s in a Lithium Battery? Lithium batteries are composed of various elements, including lithium-ion or lithium-polymer cells, a protective casing, electrolytes, and valuable metals [...]

## [What Happens When Solar Panels Are Thrown Away?](https://www.metechrecycling.com/2025/07/10/what-happens-when-solar-panels-are-thrown-away/)
The solar industry is booming. Across rooftops, deserts, and fields, panels are being installed at record pace to meet ambitious renewable energy goals. But there’s a challenge the industry is only beginning to face: what happens when these panels stop producing power? Solar panels typically last 20–30 years, meaning the first generation of large-scale installations is already approaching retirement. By the 2030s, millions of tons of solar panels will reach end-of-life each year. Without a plan, many of them risk ending up in landfills or being processed by unregulated facilities that don’t properly handle the materials inside. This is the [...]

Responsible Recycling for Renewable Energy Sources is Critical Solar panel recycling companies like METech Recycling are invested in a greener future through renewable energy sources. Solar energy plays a pivotal role in the combat against climate change as we move away from fossil fuels. According to a study by the U.S Department of Energy, 40% of the nation’s electricity has the potential to be powered by solar energy by 2035. However, as the number of decommissioned solar panels grow, recyclers, businesses, and consumers must step up to ensure that they are properly disposed of. How Do Solar Panels [...]

# Certified Data Destruction
**Protect Your Data with Certified Data Destruction**
[![Certified Data Destruction - R2v3 Certified](https://www.metechrecycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/R2-Stacked-300x185.png)](https://sustainableelectronics.org/)
Certified Data Destruction – R2v3 Certified
In today’s digital world, data security is paramount. At Metech Recycling, we provide Certified Data Destruction services that ensure your sensitive information is permanently and securely erased. Our **R2v3-certified** process guarantees compliance with industry-leading security and environmental standards, giving you the peace of mind that your data is handled with the highest level of integrity.
**METech Recycling Secure Data Destruction Services**
  * **Secure Certified Physical Destruction** – METech physically destroys hard drives, solid-state drives, and other storage media, rendering data completely irretrievable.
  * **Certified Software Data Eradication** – Our advanced software-based data wiping methods ensure that digital information is securely removed and totally unrecoverable.
  * **R2v3 Certified Compliance** – As an **R2v3-certified** facility, METech adheres to the highest standards in responsible recycling and data security. We meet the strictest regulatory and environmental requirements in the industry.


### **Multi-Layered Data Erasure Options**
We offer multiple levels of software-based data erasure—from single-pass to seven-pass—designed to meet the strictest industry standards. Our services comply with:
  * NIST standards
  * Department of Defense standards
  * ITAR registered

### **Compliance-Ready Documentation**
Each job includes:
  * Certificates of Data Destruction

These documents are available via our secure client portal and are formatted to support audits, legal compliance, and internal governance protocols.

# **Data Center Solutions**
## Scalable Decommissioning, Auditing, and Lifecycle Management
At METech Recycling, we specialize in **Data Center Solutions** that are tailored to meet the complex demands of today’s data-driven infrastructure. Data center managers face constant pressure—from growing hardware inventories and compliance regulations to sustainability goals and the need for secure asset disposition. Our scalable, turnkey services are designed to help you manage these challenges with confidence, minimize downtime, protect sensitive data, and optimize return on investment.
### Onsite and Remote Decommissioning
Whether you’re closing down a server room or transitioning an entire data center floor, METech provides comprehensive decommissioning services both onsite and remotely. Our trained technicians manage every step of the process, including:
  * Safe removal of racks, servers, and cabling
  * Organized cable management and dismantling
  * Systematic labeling and asset cataloging

We ensure that every asset is handled with care and according to best practices, reducing risk while increasing operational efficiency.
### Asset Recovery and Redeployment

These assets can be securely redeployed within your network or resold through vetted remarketing channels. All data is sanitized according to Department of Defense (DoD) and NIST 800-88 standards, ensuring total data security and regulatory compliance.
### Real-Time Chain of Custody and Auditing
We provide a fully documented, real-time chain of custody from point of pickup to final disposition. Each asset is tracked using barcode scanning and live inventory systems, giving your team peace of mind and audit-readiness at every stage.
### Environmental Compliance and Certifications
With **[R2v3](https://sustainableelectronics.org/), ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015, ISO 45001:2018 certifications**, METech ensures your retired equipment is processed with the highest environmental and ethical standards in the industry.

# CCompliant Data Security
### **Data Protection That Goes Beyond Compliance**
Protecting your organization’s sensitive information is at the heart of our operations. As data privacy regulations grow more complex, we ensure you stay ahead of the curve with our best-in-class data destruction services.
### **Multi-Layered Data Erasure Options**
We offer multiple levels of software-based data erasure—from single-pass to seven-pass—designed to meet the strictest industry standards. Our services comply with:
  * NIST standards
  * Department of Defense standards
  * ITAR registered
  * HIPAA compliant
  * R2v3 data handling protocols


Every data-bearing device is tracked from arrival to final disposition through our inventory system, and is assigned a unique identifier to ensure full chain-of-custody compliance.
### **In-House Physical Destruction**
When devices cannot be erased through software, we physically destroy them onsite using industrial shredders. This is essential for non-functioning hard drives or proprietary equipment. METech is one of the few electronics recyclers with in-house shredding capacity, ensuring added security and speed.
### **Compliance-Ready Documentation**
Each job includes:
  * Certificates of Data Destruction
  * Chain-of-custody logs
  * Compliance summaries


These documents are available via our secure client portal and are formatted to support audits, legal compliance, and internal governance protocols.
**Protecting Privacy, Securing Peace of Mind**

# IT Asset Management (ITAM/ITAD)
### **Maximize Performance, Protect Value, Ensure Compliance**
[![R2 Certified](https://www.metechrecycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/R2-Stacked-300x185.png)](https://sustainableelectronics.org/)At METech Recycling, our IT Asset Management (ITAM/ITAD) services are designed for enterprise clients looking to responsibly and profitably manage the lifecycle of their technology. As a nationally certified R2v3 Responsible Recycler, we go beyond simple asset tracking. We provide full diagnostic testing, grading, data sanitization, and refurbishment of IT equipment to ensure functionality and resale value while maintaining strict compliance standards.
### **Comprehensive Diagnostic Testing**
Every device we receive is subjected to rigorous testing using industry-grade software and procedures. This includes functionality checks, performance assessments, and a grading process that categorizes each asset by condition—enabling more accurate reporting and market positioning.

Before any asset is approved for resale or redeployment, all data is removed using NIST SP800-88-compliant processes. We also offer secure physical destruction options for storage media. Our approach eliminates data breach risks while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations like HIPAA and FACTA.
### **Recover Value Through Resale**
Once cleared of data, devices are refurbished to extend product life and maximize returns. Our in-house technicians replace defective parts, update firmware, and restore appearance and functionality to like-new condition. This not only improves market value but also supports a circular economy by reducing e-waste.
### **Customized ITAM Programs**

# IT Asset Recovery
### **Unlock the Value of Your Retired Technology with IT Asset Recovery**
At METech Recycling, our IT Asset Recovery program empowers organizations to maximize the return on their retired, surplus, or decommissioned electronic assets. Whether you’re upgrading equipment, consolidating offices, or clearing out storage, our end-to-end recovery process ensures you extract the greatest possible value—while remaining fully compliant with environmental regulations and data security requirements. We help transform aging tech into revenue, all while keeping sustainability and accountability at the forefront.
### **Comprehensive Evaluation and Grading**
Every piece of recovered equipment is subjected to a thorough evaluation using our standardized grading system. This process includes hardware testing, cosmetic inspection, and functional diagnostics. Devices that pass these evaluations are securely sanitized using industry-standard data destruction protocols and, when feasible, refurbished to enhance resale value. Only items that meet our quality and functionality standards are forwarded to appropriate resale or redeployment channels, minimizing waste and maximizing ROI.
### **Multi-Channel Resale Strategy**
To ensure top-tier value for your assets, we leverage a diversified resale strategy. This includes trusted wholesale resellers, curated online marketplaces, and targeted auction platforms. Our internal market analytics team continuously monitors demand trends and pricing benchmarks across different device categories, helping us determine the most lucrative resale path for each asset. This approach not only optimizes financial return but also expedites asset turnover.
### **Charitable and Employee Redeployment Options**
Looking to make a positive impact? We support clients in repurposing refurbished equipment through charitable donations or employee purchase programs. Whether you’re equipping a local nonprofit or offering discounted devices to staff, we handle secure data wiping, inventory tracking, and logistics—ensuring that these alternative channels are as safe and seamless as possible.
### **Environmental Responsibility**
For devices that can’t be reused or sold, METech provides responsible end-of-life recycling that complies with the highest industry standards, including R2v3 certification. Our processes prioritize maximum material recovery while enforcing a strict zero-landfill policy, reducing environmental harm and supporting a circular economy.
### **Financial Transparency and Reporting During IT Asset Recovery**
With every asset recovery project, METech delivers a comprehensive financial breakdown. Clients receive clear reports that detail gross and net resale values, refurbishment and processing costs, logistics fees, and the final return on investment (ROI). This level of transparency ensures full accountability and helps organizations assess the true value of their recovered technology.

### Metech History Timeline
**1875**  
The Wildberg Brothers facility, (aka Boliden Metech) was a metal reclamation plant which operated in San Francisco between 1907 and 1986. The site was approximately 5 1/2 acres in size. This facility was used as an antimony smelting plant which operated for an unknown duration beginning in 1875.
**1907**  
The Site was purchased in 1907 by the Wildberg Brothers Company who operated a metal reclamation facility. The operations included milling, sampling, assaying of scrap materials, electrolytic deposition of silver, stripping of gold, and copper concentration. Gold, platinum, palladium, silver and copper were recovered as finished products.
**1968**  
RMI traces its origin back to 1968 in Woonsocket, R.I. At that time, Refinemet focused on precious metals and tantalum recovery. Refinemet expanded into electronics recycling by “default” in the late ’70s and early ’80s because customers like AT&T, Burroughs, DEC and IBM had large pieces of equipment that they were retiring.
**1980**  
Wildberg Brothers sold the facility to Refinemet International (RMI) in 1980. RMI primarily used the facility for precious metal scrap processing and refining.
**1983**  
In 1983, shortly after expanding into processing end-of-life electronics, Boliden, a smelting and mining company based in Stockholm, Sweden, purchased RMI and renamed it Boliden Metech. It was during this time that Metech moved the East Coast operation from Woonsocket, RI to Mapleville, RI.  
Boliden used the San Francisco facility primarily for precious metal scrap processing but did not engage in refining operations at the Site. Operations conducted onsite consisted of material sorting, sampling, and assaying before the materials were containerized for shipment to Boliden facilities overseas for processing.
**1986**  
Boliden discontinued all operations at the San Francisco site in May 1986. All buildings at the site, with the exception of Building 1, the Office Building, Building 2, the Laboratory; and Buildings 11-12, the Melt Shop, and Mechanical Processing area, were demolished and the business was moved to our current location in Gilroy, CA. Trelleborg, (the parent company of Boliden), later spun off the smelting operations under the name Boliden but retained Metech as a recycling and processing operation.  
In 2002 Viking Investment and Asset Management, based in Johannesburg, South Africa, bought Metech.
**2005**  
In 2005 Metech was acquired by MTI Corp and relocated the corporate offices from Mapleville, RI to Worcester, Mass. The company designed a processing line to include shredders and downstream separation equipment.  
At this time, Metech also discontinued receiving precious-metals-containing hazardous waste and scaled back its other local precious metals refining businesses that were not adding value to the company’s focus on integrated electronics recycling.
**2007**  
In 2007 Metech was acquired by “Centillion Environment and Recycling Ltd” of Singapore.  
In 2008 Centillion purchases “Guaranteed Recycling Xperts” (GRX) with locations in Denver, CO, Salt Lake City, UT and Omaha, NE.
**2009**  
2009 Centillion merges Metech and GRX under the Metech Recycling banner.  
In 2012 Centillion was renamed Metech International
**2016**  
In 2016 the Worcester facility was relocated once more to its current location in nearby Clinton, MA. At this time, corporate operations were permanently transferred to the Gilroy, CA facility.
**2018**  
In 2018 Metech Recycling was purchased by First America Metals Group and taken Private.
**2021**  
METech continues operating today with a strong national footprint serving industries such as medical, military, government, education, manufacturing and more.
