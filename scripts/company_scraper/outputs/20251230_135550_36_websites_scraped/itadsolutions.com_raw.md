IT ASSET DISPOSITION
**global ewaste solutions**
[Schedule pickup](https://www.itadsolutions.com/schedule)
** _A message from the iTAD team during this COVID-19 Pandemic_**
  
To our customers, clients, partners and families, the team at iTAD Solutions wants to first wish you the safest and healthiest regards. It’s certainly a challenging time for many of us as we navigate hurdles that change day by day. 
Many of the clients and people we work with are currently sheltering in place, however, if you work in the bioscience, medical and research fields, we want to first say thank you, and that we will continue to support you so that you may focus on one shared core goal: to stop this disease. 
We wanted to let you know the steps our company has taken to continually service and support our client and customer’s needs, while keeping employee safety at the top of our minds. 
**First and foremost, all client data and equipment housed in our facility is safe and protected by our NAID (National Association of Information Destruction) AAA Certified processes, including 24 hour surveillance and monitoring.**
**Our company itself is still open and operating, with limited crews.**
With San Francisco, California, and Dallas governance decreeing shelter in place mandates, we have taken dramatic steps to encourage social distancing and limit onsite staff to only essential processors. 
  * In addition to minimizing the number of staff, we are rotating employees and splitting shifts to limit workforce contact. 


  * Staff has been trained to undergo enhanced cleaning procedures, including sanitation and isolation of incoming equipment. 


  * The rest of the staff has been assigned to work from home, or to simply shelter in place. 


  * Travel is being restricted, and in person meetings have been replaced with teleconferencing. 


  * We are actively working with our clients to engage in contact-less pickups, where interaction can be kept to a minimum. 


  * Non-essential pickups have been postponed.


  * Community pickups and ewaste drop-offs have been temporarily stopped.


  * Out-of-State and International Pickups, if not restricted, are still taking place with local governance allowance. 
  * We are also asking our downstream partners to practice the same strict precautions to prevent exposure, and limit social contact. 


The end result of these actions will undoubtedly add time and delays to our normal processing windows. We apologize for this and ask for your understanding as we all endure this challenging time together.
Thank you and keep safe.
John Bekiaris & The entire iTAD Solutions Team

Our ITAD Network of Partners means your risks are minimized
What is most important to you? Maximum value recovery? Highest levels of data security? Do you require recycling partners that are industry certified? Certifications such as R2, NAID, or BAN?
With ITAD Solutions, we manage these choices for you. And with no commitment to any one downstream vendor, we are able to constantly adapt to evolving needs and mitigate risks in the rare case a partner is removed from our network.

What will you leave behind?
A solid ITAD program works hand in hand with your EH&S to ensure corporate responsibility goals are achieved.
Our sustainability reports show you how much you've reused vs. recycled annually, and calculates that into detailed carbon savings report to show your impact on the environment.
With a zero landfill goal, and zero ewaste export policy, we consider it our highest priority to steward your end of life electronics, and give them a second life that emphasizes reuse before recycling.
Good for the environment. Good for your bottom line.

We opened our headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area ten years ago, armed with over 25 years of experience in the industry. Although local pickups in the Bay Area are our key strength, we’ve expanded our service capabilities nationwide, as well as across the globe. We’ve even opened up our newest facility in Dallas, Texas.
If you’re in the San Francisco Bay Area, you may have already met our dedicated logistics and pickup teams zipping from business to business, collecting IT assets. 
In many of the massive data centers, you may have noticed us sending in teams to break rooms down, and prepare thousands of servers for their decommissioning. 
Perhaps you recognize our voices from the dozens of calls we send out daily making sure our global network of 120 partners is on top of their game.
Or maybe you bought a computer (or a pallet of them) from one of our dedicated sales team members.
Whatever the case, we’re always looking for new partnerships to develop.
Give us a call today, whatever the need.
