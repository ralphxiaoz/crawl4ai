  * [Home](https://drmcompany.com/)
  * /
  * [Businesses](https://drmcompany.com/business/)

  * [IT Asset Recovery](https://drmcompany.com/business-it-asset-recovery/)


We work closely with our clients to determine the right asset recovery strategy that is most closely aligned to your business objectives. How we recover value from your equipment is part of most conversations.
### IT Asset Recovery Options
  * Refurbish and resell through wholesale and retail channels
  * Refurbish and redeploy within your business
  * Dismantle and recovery parts and components for reuse
  * Equipment that no longer has useful life is responsibly recycled


### Refurbishment
Our refurbishment services address cosmetic defects, broken or missing components and testing the unit for functionality prior to redeployment. Memory or hard drive upgrades can provide cost effective performance boosts and help further extend the asset lifecycle.
### Resell IT Assets
Remarketing used equipment maximizes return on investment (ROI) and minimizes environmental impact. When assessing the resale potential of an IT asset, we consider the age, functionality, appearance and overall condition of the asset.
## How We Are Different
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pricing-data.jpg)
#### Smart Pricing Analytics
Our proprietary pricing tool monitors key online marketplaces, to track sale value of completed transactions. We leverage this information for benchmarking and to forecast price variations and trends. Using data to model pricing in a fast-changing marketplace enables us to optimize our selling price in secondary markets.
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/laptop-screen.jpg)
#### Microsoft Authorized Reseller
DRM is a Microsoft Authorized Refurbisher (MAR). Our MAR status certifies we install a genuine Windows operating system on all of our laptops and PCs. Having an up-to-date operating system on laptops and PCs increases the selling price of assets.
## Profitable Resale Channels
Clients benefit from our global market presence and our flexibility in selling their assets through multiple wholesale and retail channels. These include:
  * Product sales through popular retail e-commerce websites
  * Bulk resale to brokers through auction portals


## Redeploy
Money spent on IT equipment continues to increase for most companies. Redeployment of used assets within your company can decrease the total cost of ownership by extending the overall asset lifecycle. Redeployment programs demonstrate fiscal and environmental responsibility.  
  
DRM redeploys equipment within the same company location or can facilitate delivery of equipment to different company locations or to remote employees.  

## Storage
DRM can support 60 day storage and redeploy services of clients’ IT assets. These services are supported through our global warehouse capacity, an inventory management system, and a detailed tracking system. IT assets are safely stored and carefully tracked, providing full accountability for our clients.
### Mobile Device Redeployment
DRM provides companies with mobile device redeployment.  
  
A trusted partner delivering comprehensive solutions:
  * Device redeployment
  * Device remarketing, including kitting
  * Software flashing and upgrades
  * Parts harvesting and recovery

#### IT Asset Disposition (ITAD)
A well-defined, systematic program to manage disposition of retired IT assets is key to protecting your data, controlling your assets, maximizing value recovery and meeting regulatory and corporate risk management requirements.
IT asset disposal (ITAD) programs continue to evolve and mature. Regulations requiring companies to protect personally identifiable information (PII) of customers, employees and other stakeholders continue to become more restrictive. Data security is a top priority. Companies are seeking data secure and environmentally compliant programs to manage potential risks associated with unaccountable disposal of obsolete equipment.
National and global companies are taking charge of fragmented regional ITAD programs and consolidating and standardizing to a single program, managed holistically and consistently.
#### Ensure Responsible IT Asset Disposal 
This five page white paper offers 6 tips for building a successful IT asset disposal program. Systematic handling of assets, risk management, data security, inventory tracking, reporting, asset resale and recycling are discussed.

#### The DRM Portal
The DRM Portal provides a secure and user friendly platform for managing ITAD and recycling services, tracking IT assets and generating reports. The Sims Portal provides a holistic view of equipment, from the time an order is placed to final disposition. Work orders are centrally managed and asset reuse and recycling reports are conveniently available.
A roles based access control system enables authorized users to securely log in from anywhere.
### Data Integration for Client Assets
DRM is able to support EDI or API integration to client systems to seamlessly share information about asset disposition.  

#### Multi-Site Support
DRM recognizes the importance of managing information from your multiple office locations and providing a holistic view of assets. Reports can be generated based on shipping location. During onboarding, we can pre-populate the portal with information about each of your locations and point of contact for quick setup.
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/drmpl.png)
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rpts.jpeg)
### Report by Item – Asset Reporting
Clients want item by item reporting for data bearing assets and assets that are resold or redeployed. We provide several standard reports that provide chain of custody proof points that confirm assets receipt, count and condition. Reports include make, model, serial number, asset tag, date received, weight and how and when the asset was reused or recycled. DRM supports multiple currencies and additional data capture for clients with unique requirements.  

#### Dashboard View
Besides our standard reports, the DRM Portal supports customized lookups and reports. Search by category, client reference number, model, order number or received data. View asset specific information including category, description and diagnostic results.
### Electronic Recycling – Weight Reports
If the unit of measure for client reports is by weight, pre-processing will include weighing shipments as they are received and accounting for commodity recovery after recycling. When required, equipment to be recycled can be sorted by type or material to facilitate more detailed client reporting based on weight, material type and piece count.
#### Certificate of Destruction
The Certificate of Destruction provides proof that all e-waste or other proprietary equipment has been destroyed and disposed in an environmentally compliant manner. 
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/erwr1.png)
## Additional Reporting
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ddr.png)
## Data Destruction
We provide Certificates of Data Destruction to confirm data has been destroyed, compliant with relevant regulations and standards. It is common to include project number, client name, asset numbers, serial number of hard drive and asset type.
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/csd.png)
## Financial Reporting
Financial reporting provides financial settlement details by asset. This report also documents date received, the client location from which the equipment was received, make, model, serial number, asset ID and weight, if applicable. Client use this report to close out internal financial and asset management records. Client defined fields are available for additional data capture when required.
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cerenv.png)
## Certificate of Sustainability
The Certificate of Sustainability shows the beneficial environmental offsets (carbon emission reduction) gained by reusing and recycling retired IT assets and electronics. Carbon emission reductions can be calculated based on number of IT assets disposed or can be calculated based on weight (in lbs or kgs) of e-waste recycled.

## Circular Economy Explained

  * [Client Sustainability](https://drmcompany.com/client-sustainability/)
  * /
  * [Circular Economy Explained](https://drmcompany.com/circular-economy-explained/)


DRM is committed to the principles of the Circular Economy. In fact, the very core of our business model is based on these principles. Embedded in all our processes is the commitment to reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and avoiding unnecessary waste.
The Circular Economy aims to reject the lifecycle of the Linear Economy, which is based in part on the needless waste of perfectly good components. By adhering to the Circular Economy, we believe that we can still benefit from the ongoing advances and innovation that IT and technology companies offer, but in a sustainable way.
Every redundant IT asset, regardless of its perceived state, has potential re-use value, either fully refurbished for its original purpose or in its parts. These devices can be re-used by the original owner, sold to a secondary user, or indeed donated to charity. When IT assets do reach their End of Life (EOL), we believe that they should be recycled in line with the best environmental standards and nothing should be sent to landfill.
By giving businesses and consumers the ability to use their IT assets in an environmental and sustainable way, the Circular Economy is playing a crucial part in our global transition to net-zero emissions.
#### Linear Material Model
**Use and Dispose Model**
Traditional supply chains assume virgin materials are used to manufacture new products, products are used and then discarded as waste.
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lmm-mod.png)
The traditional linear materials economy model, where raw materials are mined, products are produced and landfilled at the end of their useful life, has proven to be unsustainable as the earth’s population continues to grow and we consume more products.
### Circular Economy Model
Moving from an unsustainable linear model to a circular model is the path forward to avoid depleting finite raw material resources. Reusing and recycling retired IT assets and electronics enables companies to benefit from better environmental outcomes and improvement to the bottom line.
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rd-ce-mod.png)
### DRM Services Enable the Circular Economy
On behalf of our clients, DRM is responsible for discarded electronics. We refurbish, repair, remanufacture and restore equipment for continued useful life. In addition to facilitating reuse of electronic equipment, DRM also recycles equipment, transforming waste to raw material. Recycling diverts material from landfill or incineration and provides a feedstock for making next generation products.
Working together, DRM and our clients can challenge conventional models of design, manufacturing, distribution, reuse, and recycling, in an increasingly global, value-driven, competitive, regulated and resource-challenged marketplace.
#### Closed Loop Solutions
We encourage a more strategic discussion with our clients on how to manage electronic product lifecycles, reimagine supply chains, extend the useful life of IT assets and reuse and recycle products.

#### DRM – Enabler of the Circular Economy
DRM engages collaboratively with global clients to re-examine business models and to plan for continual evolution towards a circular economy model. Clients leverage our knowledge about disposition of retired electronic assets, managing their movement through reverse supply chains, and quantifying the carbon impact of these assets. 
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/recreu.png)
#### Reuse
DRM works with clients to identify opportunities to reuse and redeploy equipment. This extends the useful life of IT equipment. Reuse avoids the emissions associated with manufacturing new products, reduces reliance on raw materials, avoids landfill and can contribute to localizing supply chains. It makes sense for your bottom line and your sustainability goals.
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/recele.png)
#### Recycling
Recycling obsolete electronics diverts material from landfill or incineration. DRM invests in innovative technology to produce clean recyclables that can be used as a feedstock to replace virgin raw materials in making new products. Extracting more value from materials, through reuse and recycling, is a good economic decision and plays an important role in the circular economy.
### New Sustainability Calculator for IT and Data Center Assets
Recognizing you manage what you measure, we have developed a sustainability calculator for measuring carbon emissions avoided by choosing to reuse and recycle electronics.
DRM’ Sustainability Calculator provides our clients with industry-leading environmental reporting when reusing, redeploying and recycling all types of IT equipment.
The calculator is powered by manufacturers’ data on the 14 most commonly used IT equipment in the data center and workplace. Clients are able to calculate carbon emissions avoided from their IT asset disposition program, which enables:
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/caldrm.jpeg)
  * Aligning their IT asset disposition program closer to their corporate sustainability goals
  * Making smarter and more sustainable decisions about managing IT assets
  * Quantifying Scope 3 emissions associated with disposition of used IT assets
  * Global decommissioning , data destruction, reuse and recycling services
  * Improving value recovery
  * Measuring and improving environmental outcomes


### What is Reported?
Carbon emissions avoided when reusing whole units and components, and recycling of IT equipment is reported from the calculator. In addition to tonnes of carbon emissions avoided, we also provide carbon equivalency metrics, which provide a user-friendly way to visualize the results.
The DRM Sustainability Calculator provides clients with transparent sustainability reporting suitable to contribute to corporate carbon accounting. Our robust and up-to-date data sets and transparent calculations provide proof points to withstand internal and external audits.  

### How It Was Built
The engine behind the calculator is independently sourced and verified and is regularly updated. It includes more product categories than others on the market, including a wide range of cloud materials. Energy consumption data is sourced by country. We use our own proprietary production information, including the green energy utilized in our facilities. This data yields more accurate calculated results.  

### Benefits of Working with DRM
We provide periodic reports to our clients, detailing carbon avoided by their current ITAD program. Because IT equipment continues to evolve, we recognize the importance of updating our calculator to stay in sync with the marketplace. We ensure that the information is current and relevant through regular maintenance and updates, including new product categories and the most current assay findings.  

### Reusing Assets Yields Significant Sustainability Gains
The new DRM Sustainability Calculator empowers our clients to quantify carbon emissions avoided, not only from recycling, but also from the reuse of IT assets. Most calculators only provide results for recycled assets, giving an incomplete view of a program’s total carbon footprint. Incorporating reuse data provides a more complete overview, providing clients with the opportunity to make more sustainable-focused decisions on asset processing.

### Original Design Servers (ODS)
Custom-built servers and processors are common in hyperscale data centers. These proprietary servers change the typical reuse / recycling decisions for retired IT equipment.
We work with clients to provide guidance on how this equipment is best repurposed.
  * Can parts be harvested for stocking inventory or resale?
  * How do we ensure proprietary parts are secured and destroyed?
  * Can equipment be redeployed to other company-owned locations?
  * Is secure recycling the best way to protect any intellectual property?

#### Compliance
### Data Protection Regulation and Compliance
Companies across the globe are required to have processes in place to ensure personally identifiable information (PII) is protected. Legislation has been implemented in many countries to ensure companies have defined processes in place to ensure personal data protection within their organization. The new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) legislation, implemented in May 2018 is the most recent and impactful versions of regulatory requirements. 
### Helping Our Clients Meet Legislative Requirements
DRM operates globally and works with our clients to ensure data on retired assets is destroyed. In addition to our data destruction services, one of the biggest deliverables we offer to our clients is “demonstrability”. For audit purposes associated with regulatory compliance, defined processes that enable our clients to demonstrate discipline, due diligence and best practices in how assets were handled and data destroyed are critical. Documentation (inventory reports, Certificates of Data Destruction, where and when events happened) from DRM provides proof that processes were followed and that data was responsibly destroyed. Should a client undergo a legislative audit, our clients can demonstrate that assets and data were disposed compliant with regulations, in a consistent, repeatable and predictable manner.

![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/envmill.png)
### Environmental Compliance
Clients trust DRM to properly dispose of e-waste and hazardous waste associated with ITAD and electronics recycling programs. DRM employs strong environmental, health and safety (EH&S) teams at our facilities who provide environmental oversight of our operations and manage our facility certifications. SLS seeks certifications to demonstrate to clients that our facilities are responsibly managed, adhere to local, regional and federal regulations and demonstrate best industry practices.
Our processes are consistent with Environmentally Sound Management (ESM) principles:
  * All electronic hardware is 100 percent recycled
  * Nothing is exported unless it is to an ESM facility
  * Defined and comprehensive EH&S practices
  * Comprehensive Industrial Hygiene Control
  * Ensure full downstream accountability for disposition of hazardous waste. Downstream vendors are audited.
  * Fully permitted


### Landfill
No e-waste is sent to landfill by SLS. Some packaging & inert materials resulting from our processing of electronic waste does result in landfill disposal (<1%). We separate, crush and recycle cardboard and Styrofoam packaging that is a by-product of our operations and sort and donate reusable items such as laptop bags and paper from printers and copiers.   
  
**Certificate of Recycling and Certificate of Sustainability Available.**

#### Data Center Decommissioning – The Ultimate Guide
Do you have questions? We have answers. DRM answers the most commonly asked questions related to data center decommissioning.
#### Section 1. What is IT asset disposition (ITAD) for data centers and how does it work?
Data center ITAD describes the process of systematically decommissioning and retiring IT assets from your live environment and ensuring they are disposed in a data safe, environmentally responsible manner. Retired IT assets are resold on behalf of the data center, redeployed to another company owned facility, or recycled. 
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/prtlfeatr.png)
#### On-site at the Data Center
Equipment is decommissioned, inventoried and packed and shipped to an ITAD company that manages reuse and recycling of retired IT equipment. It is important that data-bearing assets are managed securely throughout the process. Most commonly, data is destroyed prior to assets leaving the data center.
#### At the ITAD Facility
Assets with reuse potential are refurbished and prepared for resale. If whole units cannot be reused, parts are recovered for resale. Obsolete equipment is recycled.
Most data centers require a documented audit trail that confirms how and when assets were disposed and that recycled equipment was managed in an environmentally compliant manner. ITAD companies can provide complete chain of custody reports, sales reports on assets sold, certificates of data destruction and environmental reporting for recycling. A disciplined approach to data center asset management is important on-site, during transport and off-site at the ITAD facility.
#### Measuring Success
Data center managers want to recover a percentage of their investment from the sale of their retired equipment. It is also important to ensure regulatory requirements, internal risk management and data security policies are met.
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ramatsrs.png)
### Create a Circular, Low-Carbon Economy
Resourceful reuse and recycling of data center equipment contributes to the broader shift toward a circular economy, decreasing the demand for resources required to produce new products and reducing landfill volumes.
[Roadmap for Circular Electronics](https://drmcompany.com/circular-economy/)
#### An Important Tip!
Industry certifications are important in the ITAD and e-waste recycling industry. While industry certification does not guarantee performance, it provides a baseline of vetting to ensure your equipment is not irresponsibly handled. There are many reported cases of ITAD vendors taking shortcuts in processing used IT equipment. Shortcuts put you at risk of embarrassing headlines of data exposure and fines associated with illegal export and environmentally irresponsible disposal.
#### Section 2. What types of data center equipment are included in ITAD?

### Decommissioning   
Critical Infrastructure
Direct Resource Management (DRM) works on many data center projects. We are unique in this industry in that we provide decommissioning and disposition solutions for IT equipment, electrical and mechanical systems.
DRM provides decommissioning and disposition services for IT equipment, decommissioning and recycling of electrical and mechanical systems. Our services are particularly useful for complete data center shutdowns and is popular when decommissioning edge data centers.
DRM handles the servers and blades, storage devices, networking and electrical equipment listed above. We also provide secure hard drive destruction services. All work is performed by field technicians and site personnel to coordinate heavy equipment movement.

#### Section 3. What happens to equipment after it leaves the data center?
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dcflow.jpg)
Ever wonder what happens to your used data center equipment after decommissioning? There’s an entire industry set up to recover value from used equipment and maximize resource recovery, either through reuse or responsible recycling. This industry is known as the IT asset disposition (ITAD) and e-waste recycling industry.  

### How It Works
Equipment is shipped to an ITAD facility specializing in handling data center equipment. These processing facilities are set up to triage equipment systematically, destroy data and prepare equipment for reuse or recycling. Some ITAD facilities handle reuse and recycling. Other facilities handle reuse and will send obsolete hardware and e-waste to a separate facility for recycling. Most commonly housed in an industrial warehouse, there are areas within the ITAD facility dedicated to performing specific tasks. These sites have taken on added importance as companies seek to reduce their carbon impact. Reusing and recycling data center equipment contributes to the circular economy and improves financial results.
### 1. Inventory of Assets
When received at the ITAD facility, an electronic inventory of assets is typically done and confirmed with your organization. At a minimum, asset make, model and serial number is captured. This information becomes part of an electronic chain of custody record to confirm secure and compliant handling of the IT assets.  

### 2. Data Destruction
Data is destroyed by data erasure, shredding, crushing or degaussing of storage media. As shown in the chart, data erasure allows secure reuse of storage devices. Magnetic hard drives and magnetic tapes, solid state drives and optical storage devices each require different data destruction methods. Certificates of Data Destruction (CODD) are provided by the vendor during the project. The CODD demonstrates compliance to corporate and regulatory requirements, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  

### 3. Refurbish and Redeploy IT Equipment
Data center equipment can be reconfigured and refurbished and then redeployed to another company owned data center. If whole units cannot be reused, spare part recovery can be a smart option to maintain legacy equipment. Redeployment of whole units and parts is a great way to conserve resources, save money and reduce the carbon impact of your IT ecosystem.  

### 4. Refurbish and Resell IT Equipment
If there is no internal need for the decommissioned equipment, it can be resold on your behalf. Equipment condition and age of equipment is evaluated, to determine whether equipment will be reused or recycled. These behind-the-scenes activities help offset the cost of decommissioning, data destruction, shipping and reporting.  

### 5. Parts Recovery if Whole Unit Reuse is not Possible
A parts recovery program provides an additional revenue source when assets cannot be sold as a whole unit.  

### 6. Recycle Obsolete or Proprietary Equipment
Any equipment that is obsolete or beyond economical repair is recycled. The recycling process separates steel, plastic, aluminum, copper and precious metals from each other, which then allows for reuse of these commodities in next generation products. 
### 7. Reporting
Once resold, recycled or redeployed, reporting helps document an audit trail for the final disposition of all assets. Asset reporting should include detailed asset information, final disposition, pricing, and dates of significant activities. You should have the ability to receive data feeds or view online reports and be able to download .csv through a portal, which might include Certificates of Data Destruction, Certificates of Recycling and Certificates of Sustainability.  
  

#### Section 4. How do I develop a decommissioning plan?
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/plsucpr.jpg)
### Planning a Successful Project
A successful project requires planning and cooperation between data center personnel and the decommissioning vendor. The pdf shown below serves as a checklist for things to consider to ensure your team is ready and selects a vendor that meets the needs of your data center.
[Download Planning PDF](https://drmcompany.com/resources/Data-Center-Walk-Through.pdf)
### Data Center Decommissioning Plan
Download this handy checklist pdf, which covers these topics:
  * Pre-planning to be done by data center
  * Initial information to provide to vendor
  * Define in-scope and out-of-scope activities
  * Determine your reporting requirements
  * Outcomes you should expect from a vendor walk-through


#### Section 5 – How do I compare different decommissioning vendors?
  
You want to make sure your selected vendor is competent in the following areas: 
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DCServ.png)
Too often, data centers depend on established vendors who currently provide adjacent services to also provide the decommissioning and final disposition of retired assets. An existing vendor will have the advantage of being familiar with your data center environment and the people on-site. The disadvantage may be that the decommissioning and disposition services may be outside their area of expertise.
At the start of a decommissioning project, the assumption is that any required data has been backed up, software licenses are accounted for, and cancellation of maintenance contracts has been completed. All equipment targeted for decommissioning should be powered down and disconnected from the network by data center employees.
[Download Vendor Comparison PDF](https://drmcompany.com/resources/Compare_Vendors.pdf)
#### Section 6 – What hardware inventory information should I gather?
  
Accurately identifying what equipment will be decommissioned is critical. Most data centers will provide the decommissioning vendor with a list of equipment to be decommissioned. The vendor will compare this list to a physical inventory count as equipment is removed from the live environment.
Know what your company’s policy is regarding how data bearing assets are managed. Have a plan for how decommissioned lease returns will be managed. Is there an area available for the vendor to work? They will need a secure staging area with internet access where they can perform inventory counts, data destruction (if done on-site) and prepare equipment for shipment.

#### Equipment We Process and Remarket
The most common shipments we receive from businesses include both electronics that have reuse potential and equipment that is old and has no useful life. It’s our job to quickly assess whether to reuse or recycle the equipment. Recognizing that reusing electronics provides better environmental results and financial returns to our clients, we offer refurbishment, redeployment and resell services to optimize reuse potential.
Reuse of equipment eliminates the emissions associated with manufacturing new products, conserves natural resources by reducing the need for raw materials and avoids sending associated waste to landfills. This demonstrates both fiscal and environmental responsibility.
Understanding that recycling is necessary in the ITAD process, DRM proactively is at the forefront of improving recycling technology. We invest in equipment that provides cleaner commodities that can more effectively be used to manufacture new products.

  * [How We Do It](https://drmcompany.com/how-we-do-it/)


Computers and electronic equipment are made from multiple types of plastic, metal, glass and precious metals. Our goal when recycling electronics is to separate the different materials from each other. The “product” we produce from recycling is clean separated streams of recycled plastic, iron, steel, copper, aluminum, glass and precious metals. The better we separate the materials, the more ways these commodities can be used to make next generation products.
## Step 1 – Receiving and Pre-Processing
We receive, sort and process computer equipment from businesses based on client specific needs. The client reports we are able to produce depends on how equipment is handled prior to being recycled.
#### REPORTING BY WEIGHT
  
If the unit of measure for client reports is by weight, pre-processing will include weighing shipments as they are received and manual removal of hazardous items (such as batteries). When required, equipment can be sorted by type or material to facilitate more detailed client reporting based on weight.
#### REPORTING BY ITEM
  
Some clients need reporting by item instead of by weight. In this case, in addition to weighing shipments, each item received will be scanned and audited according to client requirements. Data is destroyed on data bearing items prior to recycling.  

## Step 2 – Hazard Removal
After equipment is received, the next step in computer recycling is to remove and separate hazardous materials, including batteries, toner/ink, mercury bulbs found in some scanners/printers and cathode ray tubes from monitors, which contain lead. This manual process ensures hazards are disposed in a compliant manner and is important in providing an environmentally sound solution.  

## Step 3 – Shredding
Our major recycling sites are equipped with automated industrial shredders, conveyor systems and sorting equipment. After hazards are removed, the computer equipment is fed by conveyor into a large shredder. The shredder tears the material into large pieces, about 2” to 6” in diameter. This first step prepares the e-waste to begin the process of separating plastic parts from steel, copper, aluminum, glass and other commodities.
Adjacent manned support services include hard drive destruction, parts recovery, asset repair and resell and managing safe disposal of hazardous waste.  

## Step 4 – Sorting of Commodities
After shredding, the conveyor belts push the e-waste through magnets, eddy currents, infrared cameras and air jets. These technologies sort out different material types and separate sorted material from the e-waste stream.
Iron and steel is separated from the e-waste, then aluminum, copper and circuit boards are separated. After the bulk metal is removed, the e-waste stream, which is now mainly plastic, is further separated into ABS from polystyrene plastic. In the final step, the plastic is sent through an advanced metal removal process, to remove any residual metal and improve the purity of the plastic stream.
**Details of how we separate different e-waste materials are described below:**
#### Separating Iron and Steel from e-Waste
After shredding, conveyor belts transfer the shredded computers and e-waste under a powerful magnet, which separates iron and steel from the shredded e-waste. The steel and iron are collected in pallet sized bags and prepared for sale as recycled commodity materials.
#### Separating Aluminum, Copper and Circuit Boards from e-Waste
After passing under the magnet, the e-waste continues to move via the conveyor belts through additional mechanical separators. Non-ferrous metals (aluminum, copper and circuit boards) are extracted from the e-waste stream through advanced separation equipment. A visual inspection and hand sorting improves the quality of the extracted materials. The separated streams of aluminum, copper, and circuit boards are collected in pallet sized bags and prepared for sale as recycled commodity materials.
#### Separating Plastic – A Closed Loop Solution
The remaining e-waste stream is now mostly plastic. We have developed and implemented best-in-class plastic separation technology that enables us to produce clean streams of plastic. Being able to separate one type of plastic from another is the most challenging part of recycling electronics. At the same time, complete separation of different plastics is key to using recycled plastic to make new products. We have significantly improved conventional recycling to truly close the loop for plastics recycling. Separated plastic from our recycling line is then used by compounders to produce plastic granulates that are directly used to make new electronics. This is a huge step forward in sustainable recycling as plastics are one of the most problematic materials to recycle from electronics. Few recyclers invest in this plastic separation technology.
#### Benefits of Recycling – Recycling vs. Virgin Material
The separated commodities are used to make next generation products. Increasing recycled material in making new products decreases the demand for virgin raw materials, which need to be extracted from the earth. Using recycled material in the manufacturing of new products has benefits that go far beyond material reuse. It reduces pollution and carbon emissions, reduces energy and water consumption and keeps useful materials out of landfills.
## Step 5 – Collection and Shipment of Separated Commodities
As each commodity is separated from the e-waste stream, the material is collected in pallet sacks or large cardboard boxes and shipped to another processor or directly to a manufacturer. Using recycled material in the manufacturing of new products has benefits that go far beyond material reuse. It reduces pollution and carbon emissions, reduces energy and water consumption and keeps useful materials out of landfills.
DRM has earned a reputation of producing high quality recyclables out of our facilities. Manufacturers and secondary processors seek us out in using our recycled commodities.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

  * [Medical, Lab, and R&D Equipment](https://drmcompany.com/medical-labs/)


#### Full Lab, Medical, and Test Asset Lifecycle Solutions
  
**If managed correctly, either internally or by working with a partner to manage disposition, DRM can provide cost savings (through redeployment of items), create new revenue streams (through remarketing of items) and protect the organization’s brand.**  
  
With downsizing, mergers & acquisitions, as well as laboratory closures becoming a mainstay in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, organizations process millions of dollars in laboratory equipment and research devices that need to be repurposed, resold, or recycled. Given budget restrictions and the importance of maximizing recovery while being privy to environmental regulations, organizations can no longer afford to allow assets to sit idle or dispose of them without care. 
### Remarketing Surplus Assets
Once excess equipment has been deemed for sale, there are remarketing best practices an organization should implement in order to achieve maximum monetary recovery. These include:
  * De-brand, remove all stickers and signs indicating the current equipment owner to protect the brand from any liabilities.
  * Determine estimated values for the equipment.
  * Determine a sales channel for the equipment: online posting, private sale, local advertisement,  
remarketing via various domestic and international marketplaces.
  * Adjust marketing to attract the right buyers.
  * Sell, handle and ship.
  * Provide a monthly sales report and profit sharing.


#### Remarketing Services
### Online Auctions
In cooperation with one of the largest online auction companies DRM hosts online auctions of used High- Tech, R&D, Lab/Test, and Manufacturing Equipment. Online auctions often generate millions of dollars for  
the clients, capitalizing on equipment which has been replaced, completely written-off, or otherwise made obsolete. All auctions are supervised by trained and knowledgeable professionals.  

### Liquidations / Managed Sales
We act as a one stop shop remarketing solution for your used assets until all equipment items are purchased. This is especially useful for companies with unique or complex machinery, whose resale audience is very narrow.  

### Outright Cash Purchase
We pay cash for aa your used lab/test equipment and bear all costs associated with pickup, removal, transportation & storage. 
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fhfiegt.jpg)
### Technology Recycling
ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE  

  * Brand Protection is one of DRM’s core competencies. When Reuse and Remarketing are not an option, we destroy and properly recycle our customers‟ material in an environmentally sound manner
  * This means not only destroying the units designated for destruction, but also tracking, auditing, and reporting down-stream material flows on a lot-by-lot basis
  * Environmental Responsibility is of the utmost importance when processing any of our customers‟ material. For this reason  
DRM has implemented a company-wide Environmental Management System (EMS) to which all facilities comply


#### Online Portal
### TEST/LABASSETMANAGEMENT AND TRANSPARENT REPORTING
### Global Logistics

#### Case Study
**DRM Successfully Remarketed Specialized Laboratory Equipment for a Publicly Held Biopharmaceutical Company in Northern California Helping Them Recover Over $840,000**  

### Challenge
As one of Northern California’s leading biopharmaceutical companies continues to bring new products to market, it found itself with excess specialized equipment which was not best suited for the research and development of new products it is bringing to the market. The equipment consisted of heavy and bulky laboratory equipment such as incubators, refrigeration equipment, test and measurement equipment, and various exhaust hoods, HPLC, GC systems and Mass Spectrometers used in its labs. The client needed to reorganize its laboratory as well as its manufacturing facilities in order to accommodate new state of the art equipment. Their challenge was to recover the maximum value from their surplus laboratory, and research and development equipment to provide cash to offset its new specialized equipment purchases.  

### Solution
The client selected DRM to remarket all of their surplus equipment because of DRM’s unique approach, and its use of multiple online marketplaces. Having access to over 100 million buyers worldwide, DRM is able to remarket surplus assets to a broad range of customers ranging from end users to dealers on various platforms, thus garnering the largest exposure and highest recovery price. They continuously analyze historical prices of surplus equipment, and are able to effectively define the current market value for their clients’ surplus assets. DRM then identifies the most strategic buyers for the equipment in both domestic and international markets, providing their clients with maximum return on their capital.
DRM expertly removed all of the clients equipment from their facility and relocated it to its 20,000 square foot facility in Fremont, CA. Once on-site, their trained personnel evaluated the equipment and separated the equipment for remarketing and recycling. DRM then selected the best marketplaces with the largest client purchasing base for the remarketing of surplus assets. DRM ensures transparency by providing its clients with custom asset and market reports.  

### Results
Within a couple of months, DRM was able to sell all of the remarketed equipment at the maximum prices allowing the client to recover in excess of $840,000. DRM recovered majority of residual value of their clients equipment and its value recovery program consistently recovers 3x more value than using traditional auctions and liquidators. The cost of pickups, recycling and disposal fees are offset by the recovery so clients do not have any upfront costs in the process. Partnering with DRM, the client maximized the residual value for its equipment and has saved time and resources that would normally be spent by their personnel to manage the process.

#### Services for the Enterprise
On behalf of our enterprise clients, SLS is responsible for compliant disposition of retired IT assets and electronics. We refurbish, redeploy and resell IT assets, extending their useful life. In addition to facilitating reuse of equipment, SLS also recycles discarded electronics, transforming waste to raw material. Recycling diverts material from landfill or incineration and provides a feedstock for making next generation products.
Regardless of whether equipment is reused or recycled, we always destroy data on storage media, adhering to relevant data destruction standards.

#### RFP Template

## How We Are Different
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/service-2m.png)
#### Smart Pricing Analytics
Our proprietary pricing tool monitors key online marketplaces, to track sale value of completed transactions. We leverage this information for benchmarking and to forecast price variations and trends. Using data to model pricing in a fast-changing marketplace enables us to optimize our selling price in secondary markets.
![](https://drmcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/service-2m.png)
#### MAR (Microsoft Authorized Reseller)
SLS is a Microsoft Authorized Refurbisher (MAR). Our MAR status certifies we install a genuine Windows operating system on all of our laptops and PCs. Having an up-to-date operating system on laptops and PCs increases the selling price of assets.
## Profitable Resale Channels
Clients benefit from our global market presence and our flexibility in selling their assets through multiple wholesale and retail channels. These include:
  * Product sales through popular retail e-commerce websites
  * Bulk resale to brokers through auction portals


#### On-Site Data Destruction
Don’t take any unnecessary risks. When security is absolutely paramount, you need to ensure your data is destroyed before it leaves your premises.
We support small and large destruction services for magnetic tapes and drives, solid state drives and optical media. Our hard drive erasure services enable safe reuse of drives. We come to your location for secure data destruction services. At your convenience.
[Explore Our On-Site Services](https://drmcompany.com/on-site-data-destruction/)
#### Bulk Data Destruction
SLS is fully equipped to support large data destruction projects, on-premise at your location or at our advanced SLS processing facilities. Services include bulk shredding of storage media and bulk erasure of hard drives.
Our mobile shred trucks are sized to shred thousands of drives and tapes, at your facility. We offer witnessed destruction when media are destroyed at our processing facilities.
[Learn About Our Bulk Services](https://drmcompany.com/on-site-data-destruction/)
## Data Erasure
#### FOR: Magnetic hard drives and   
solid state drives
Erasing instead of destroying the hard drive enables clients to redeploy hard drives internally or resell erased hard drives. A great solution for destroying data, ensuring value recovery and extending the useful life of your IT equipment.
## Degaussing
#### FOR: Loose magnetic hard   
drives and backup tapes
Data is destroyed through the use of powerful electromagnetic fields. The magnetic charge renders data unrecoverable. Degaussing is quick and easy.
**IMPORTANT NOTE** : Effective only for magnetic drives and tapes. Degaussing does not destroy data on solid state hard drives.
## Hard Drive Crushing
#### FOR: Small projects (less than   
500 drives)
Our hard drive crushers provide a quick and convenient way to destroy small volumes of hard drives.

### Tip Sheet ITAD
#### **6 ITAD Tips Too Important to Ignore**
Selecting a new IT asset disposition (ITAD) vendor can be daunting. No vendor will align perfectly to a single client. A successful ITAD program is built upon a proactive and informed client working with a competent vendor. If accomplished, clients will have confidence in knowing their IT and electronic devices are processed in a secure and environmentally responsible manner. To ensure a seamless and favorable transaction, it is recommended to evaluate your ITAD program with the following considerations:
  

#### 1. Maintain a complete and accurate list of IT assets.
Many clients use IT asset management software or ERP inventory system to generate an initial list of assets in need of retirement. This becomes the master list used in their ITAD program. IT assets not on the network are not detected by the software. Unless this list is validated with a complete physical inventory and cross-checked thoroughly for inconsistencies, errors are introduced before the ITAD process begins. Without validation, it is almost impossible to fully reconcile asset tracking through final disposition. Corporate Risk Managers should have access to an accurate and dynamic inventory of when and how each IT asset is disposed of and data destroyed. Common tracking identifiers used in cross referencing inventory include make, model, serial number and asset tag.
  

#### 2. Prioritize vendor selection.
Years ago, formalized selection processes for disposal of IT assets were rare and vendor vetting was mostly non-existent. Few questions were asked and most companies were satisfied with any service with the ability to quickly haul away their retired IT equipment. Gartner, a leading IT market research firm, released their first “Magic Quadrant for North America Information Technology Asset Disposition” report in 2010. Since then, we have seen ITAD vendor selection processes mature.  
  
Most large organizations today issue a detailed RFP to evaluate ITAD vendor capabilities and strengths. RFP data generally includes information regarding compliance, data security, sustainability and value recovery. It is recommended to not focus on only one capability because you could consequently compromise another. As an example, prioritizing value recovery can compromise data security, compliance and sustainability goals.  

###### Compliance
Over the years final disposition of IT assets and digital data has taken on new significance to Corporate Officers, Risk Managers and compliance teams within organizations. IT assets inherently contain hazardous materials and ensuring all is responsibly managed and disposed of is critical to a successful ITAD program.  
  
Industry standards, such as the Responsible Recycling (R2) and WEEELABEX standards, provide baseline assurance in the evaluation process. In recent years, there has been added interest in how the manufacture and disposal of electronics impacts a circular economy evaluation.  
  
Data security requirements for disposing of IT and electronic devices have continued to develop since the United States created regulations such as HIPAA, GLBA, FACTA and PIPEDA forcing industries to think about controls, accountability, processes and security. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is one of the latest to make an impact on increasing regulatory requirements for international businesses.  
  
As a result, most Corporate Risk Managers today require a defined plan outlining how data will be systematically destroyed with an audit trail. Audit trails show disposition routes, mass balance reporting, and certificates of data destruction and responsible recycling.  

###### Data Security
A single instance of compromised data can be devastating for a company. Ensuring security of all data bearing assets is important. While no studies exist on the percentage of companies that allow data-bearing IT assets to leave their premises, Sims Lifecycle Services (SLS) estimates about 65 percent of clients require data destruction while assets are still in their custody. This percentage has increased significantly in the last three years.  
  
The increase in attention to on-site data destruction services comes as no surprise. It is one of the highest levels of security services on the market. Aside from on-site destruction services and security certifications, it is helpful to understand a company’s security management structure. Internal communications, trainings, assessments, and continuous site analysis will provide more of an indication of the level of attention a vendor is giving to data security on a daily basis.  

###### Sustainability
As most companies are starting to incorporate circular and carbon-reduction processes into their business models, IT asset lifecycle will feature as part of the journey. Your ITAD vendor should be able to help you conscientiously reduce waste, reclaim raw materials for remanufacturing, increase reuse levels and incorporate considerations for the entire lifecycle of a product into the design process.  
  
Industry experts suggest companies who will make it in the future will be those that “partner effectively with the entire circular supply chain to optimize collections, efficiently process material and find sustainable homes for the recovered commodities. Working with a single provider can reduce logistics, and is often more carbon efficient than multiple suppliers due to having a large global network.  

###### Value Recovery
The cost of a secure and responsible ITAD program is seldom budgeted in advance which leads many companies to seek revenue-neutral options.  
  
If a company depreciates their assets on their books to zero they also will not hold a value on the books for them, even though they may have value when resold on the second hand. This in some cases can leave an ITAD program to be self funding or net positive. In order to do this, consider the following: 
  * Do not delay resale. When it comes to value recovery of IT assets, timing is everything. Moore’s Law is an observation of how quickly technology evolves stating that “processor speeds, or overall processing power for computers will double every two years”. Focus on IT innovation coupled with short refresh cycles are contributing factors in why IT assets can quickly depreciate in value.
  * Minimize your risks. When commodity prices are low, there is less financial buffer for vendors to support revenue-neutral programs. In these cases, the chances of a low-cost vendor taking shortcuts increases. Low-cost options could risk inadequate protection from a security breach, environmental disaster (i.e. e-waste dumping) or non-compliance (i.e. not having required documentation in an audit). Value recovery is important but for larger, public companies is a secondary consideration after data security and compliance.
  * Understand your vendor’s resale channels and strategies. A vendor who maintains active and varied resale channels (wholesale and retail) is preferred. When reselling IT equipment you earn the best value when you master the five Ps: Price, product, promotion, placement and people. Not all vendors consider resale strategies and understand best practices for maximizing opportunities on various resale channels. This can have a big impact on value recovered for clients. Analytics and pricing software is used by vendors can help inform these important decisions.
  * Outline each vendor’s chain of custody. Moving IT assets from your facility to an ITAD processing center, and finally to buyers in secondary markets is a cost driver to be considered. Work with a vendor who efficiently manages logistics and is mindful of how these costs will directly impact revenue shared with you, as a client.


#### 3. Understand lag times.
Problems with irresponsible disposal of IT assets can surface long after an asset has been removed from a company’s live environment. This lag time can be the cause of major data and compliance threats. Data stored in an uncontrolled environment is only accumulating risk. The lag time between when a company removes an asset from their live environment and when downstream violations are identified, can be problematic for regulatory compliance audits. When an IT asset is removed from your facility for IT asset disposition or recycling, your company is still at risk if it is improperly managed. The links below document how irresponsible ITAD and recycling vendors have put corporate clients at risk.  
  

#### 4. Ensure legislative compliance and audit-ready reports.
Mistakes can be made as IT assets are moved, packaged or transported. This multi-step chain of custody introduces risks and vulnerabilities that need to be effectively managed. Ensure your chain of custody is clearly defined, documented, secure and as streamlined as possible.  
  
If one stray hard drive turns up during an audit or shows up years later in an unexpected place, your company’s ability to demonstrate consistent processes and attention to detail will be jeopardized. This might also greatly affect liability assessments.  

###### Demonstrability
For audit purposes, it is critical to have defined processes to demonstrate discipline, due diligence and best practices in how IT assets are handled and data destroyed. Documentation (i.e. inventory reports or certificates of data destruction) provides proof that processes were followed and data was responsibly destroyed.  

###### Statement of Work
When onboarding a new vendor, a written statement of work (SOW) often details how equipment is processed. This can be an important part of any corporate audit, as it demonstrates the use of a vendor who operates in a systematic and repeatable manner.  
  
A vendor should be committed to ensuring a seamless service transition by making your onboarding experience a positive one. Particularly when managing multiple entities across the globe, vendors should be able to demonstrate their tried and tested onboarding process which might include an understanding of tax and financial considerations (when working internationally), transboundary movements of equipment, varying environmental, data security and privacy legislation, and other international variations.  

###### Transparency
Once your processes are defined and documented, ensure accountability of the process and have an understanding of how you will manage it. Find a vendor who offers full transparency. A web portal option can be used to search for any asset at any time, and view an item’s status. If assets have been processed, a quick search using an identification number (i.e. serial number or asset tag) should provide details on the service, location and certificates if needed.  
  

#### 5. Maintain full accountability and make it integrated.
Final retirement of technology assets involves several departments within an organization, each with unique requirements. Partnering with a vendor who can support all of the organization’s needs in a streamlined manner can impact efficiency. Department requests might include: 
  * Proof of data security (IT department)
  * Complete audit trails of IT assets during disposition (Accounting)
  * Total value recovered from retired IT assets (Upper management)
  * Assurance of environmental and security risk protection (Corporate risk managers)
  * Estimated sustainability and environmental impact (Corporate sustainability managers)


An ITAD partner with broad capabilities can reduce administrative overhead, simplify vendor relations, assist in hitting environmental targets, and improve overall accountability. Vendor selection should consider immediate and future corporate requirements.  
  

#### 6. Create and implement a standardized program, then optimize.
For large companies many ITAD programs were initiated as site-specific processes. Today national and global companies are eliminating these fragmented regional programs, and consolidating and standardizing to a single program managed holistically and consistently.  
  
Most publicly-traded companies set and enforce requirements for the management and tracking of IT assets within their corporate environment. This discipline supports secure and documented destruction of digital data, and ensures IT assets are reconciled in accounting and IT records.  
  
Change is never easy so you can expect resistance from local teams, however a competent vendor can take the lead and offer solutions that deliver tangible business value. The goal should not be to replicate individual programs with a single vendor.  
  
It should be to reimagine how you are handling the assets, leverage efficiency gains and improve your solutions, responsibly and efficiently. Benefits of a competent single vendor to manage a national or global program will typically include:
  * Accountability of how IT assets are disposed of,
  * Assurance that offices aren’t shortcutting systems and bypassing protocols,
  * Reduction in logistics costs as handling is standardized and streamlined,
  * Consistency in audit trails,
  * Standardized invoicing and settlements,
  * Guidance in laws and requirements affecting retired IT assets,
  * Repeatable processes and audit trails due to defined roles and responsibilities,
  * Competitive pricing from reselling IT assets in volume, and 
  * Bargaining power and favorable terms.
  * Working with a strong IT asset disposition program can help your company ensure data security, brand protection and maximum IT value recovery.

### Tip Sheet Recycling
#### **Evaluate Your E-Recycler Using These 5 Factors**
There are many electronics recyclers who might not recycle at all – they merely resell valuable equipment and/or export items to developing countries. This can expose your company to a range of data security, environmental and brand reputation liabilities. Here are 5 ways your company can evaluate your e-recycler before you work with them:
  

#### 1. Review their compliance package.
Ask for your recycler’s environmental, health and safety policy and verify their procedures. Are their processes governed by standard operating procedures (SOPs)? What security measures are in place to protect your equipment? Do they wipe hard drives to NIST SP 800-88 r1 recommendations prior to resale? Are they a member of the National Association for Information Destruction (NAID)?
  

#### 2. Ensure data security is top priority.
The need for data security affects all organizations. Unfortunately, all too often, sensitive information is not secure, particularly upon equipment disposal. Ensure that your recycler is fully up-to-date with their current processes. SLS operates to the highest standards when it comes to data security. Our data wiping services provide peace-of-mind, accountability and assurance that our clients’ privacy and corporate reputation remain intact and eliminates potential compliance risks associated with retired IT assets.
  

#### 3. Discuss on-site and downstream environmental management.
Your recycler must manage your environmental exposure both on and off-site. Ask and identify where and how materials of concern such as batteries, CRT glass, and mercury bulbs are removed and stored. Is there an Environmental Manager whose primary responsibility is ensuring compliance? Off-site your recycler must conduct site audits of their downstream processors, especially for these materials of concern.
  

#### 4. Review capacity and capabilities.
Electronics are manufactured from plastics, metals, glass and precious metals. Advanced recycling requires large, expensive equipment which separates the different materials from each other. The “product” produced from recycling is clean separated streams of recycled plastic, iron, steel, copper, aluminum, glass and precious metals. The better these materials are separated, the more ways these commodities can be used to make next generation products. Advanced separation is critical in developing closed loop solutions which reduce pollution and carbon emissions, reduce energy and water consumption and keep useful materials out of landfills. An advanced recycling line can cost between $7M to $14M, depending upon its complexity. If your recycler says they handle 40M lbs per year, they’ll need a site of around 150,000 sq ft and around 100-150 staff.
  

#### 5. Conduct a thorough audit.
For the protection of your company and clients, it is recommended that you audit your recycler thoroughly. This will help prevent the risk of confidential data such as credit card information, Social Security Numbers, medical records, or the negative impact to your company’s brand and reputation if their equipment is found dumped in Asia or Africa.
