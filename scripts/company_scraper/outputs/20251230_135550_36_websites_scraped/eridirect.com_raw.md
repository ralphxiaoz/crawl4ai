**NEW YORK, June 06, 2023** –([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))–[ERI](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Feridirect.com&esheet=53416061&newsitemid=20230606005975&lan=en-US&anchor=ERI&index=1&md5=6819e71f6ab4586607fec38d83f8e5a2), the nation’s largest fully integrated IT and electronics asset disposition provider and cybersecurity-focused hardware destruction company, announced today that it has successfully completed the Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 Type II audit and has received compliance certification, making ERI the first and only SOC 2 Types I and II certified ITAD & e-waste recycler in the industry.
SOC 2 Type II compliance certification is recognized globally for its rigor in the review of organizations’ systems and controls. It affirms that ERI’s practices, policies, procedures, security, data integrity and operations meet the highest SOC 2 standards for security and data protection.
SOC 2 independent audits are conducted to review companies’ effective implementation of employee controls and training, IT systems and risk management control, product discipline, and vendor selection. SOC 2 Type II, the most extensive audit of its kind, is an attestation of controls at a service organization over a minimum six-month period. SOC 2 Type II reports on the description of controls, attests that the controls are suitably designed and implemented, and attests to the operating effectiveness of the controls.
During a SOC 2 Type II audit, independent auditors carry out field work on a sample of days across the testing period to observe how controls are implemented and how consistently effective they are in keeping potential and existing customers’ sensitive data safe, secure and fully protected. ERI has effectively met all SOC 2 Type II audit standards on a continuous basis.
“Achieving SOC 2 Type II certification further demonstrates ERI’s ongoing commitment to security, data protection and the responsible recycling of all electronic devices,” said John Shegerian, ERI’s Chairman and CEO. “Our partners and customers can feel 100% confident that we have made and continue to make every investment and operational protocol to establish and maintain the highest level of security and compliance in the industry. Our successful SOC 2 audits are also proof that we are always willing and able to provide third-party, independent audits, testing and validation to ensure our systems and controls are state-of-the-art for handling data can be fully trusted every step of the way.”
ERI’s SOC 2 examinations for both Type I and Type II compliance testing were conducted in accordance with standards from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).

# Local & State Government
Collection events, school systems at all levels, box programs, on-site shredding, asset resale and more – we know government. 
[ Speak To An ERI Expert ](https://eridirect.com/contact-us)
###  The Challenge 
What do all the following entities have in common? 
  * City of Houston
  * Philadelphia School District
  * University of Southern Illinois
  * Sweetwater Union High School District
  * Dawnville Elementary School


Their names were on electronics waste found in developing countries half way across the world, potentially impacting the health of children and damaging the environment in those countries. (Source: BAN.org and PBS Ghana: Digital Dumping Ground) 
We are confident none of these cities and institutions intentionally shipped their e-waste to Asia or Africa. However, it is an unfortunate result of budget constraints and government sourcing procedures when an unscrupulous low bidder or downstream vendor is awarded a contract. E-waste is shipped to developing countries because it is cheaper than recycling properly in the U.S. and allows unethical recyclers to exploit loopholes in U.S. law to submit low bids to government entities. 
In addition to the ethical concerns, there can be a high price to pay for U.S. and state environmental violations – saving a few pennies per pound for e-scrap disposal could result in millions of dollars in penalties or cleanup costs. 
As reported in E-Scrap News in 2018: 
> A trial is deciding whether federal Superfund law makes three South Carolina counties responsible for costs to remove CRT displays and other material abandoned by shuttered processor Creative Recycling Systems. 
> The case involves cleanup costs at a South Carolina warehouse that was used by Creative Recycling Systems (CRS). The company filed for bankruptcy in 2014, leaving 32 million pounds of CRT glass and other scrap electronic materials in storage across six states. 
> Source: <https://resource-recycling.com/e-scrap/2018/08/30/counties-and-landlord-battle-over-e-scrap-liability/>
Then there is the case of the now defunct Closed Loop Refining and Recovery. Major CRT tonnages were left behind by Closed Loop in warehouses in Arizona and Ohio — regulatory and legal action continues. 
The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) estimated that Closed Loop left behind approximately 158 million pounds of CRT glass at five sites in Arizona. The result is costly: 
> At the other 59th Avenue facility, which is owned by Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), according to documents from Closed Loop there are 42,396,000 pounds of non-leaded CRT glass as this facility; ADOT is arranging for internal funding to remove and dispose of glass, with an anticipated project start date before June 1, 2018. 
Beyond the environmental concerns and risks, local and state governments may be required to comply with the myriad of Federal and state law applicable to data security and data privacy. Data destruction legislation is in place for 14 states that apply to government entities in addition to possibly Federal requirements that may be applicable. 
###  Protect your Organization 
So, the issue is twofold: government entities must meet the challenge of both protecting data contained in end-of-life equipment while also ensuring both data and non-data bearing electronics equipment are properly recycled to comply with all applicable regulations and to protect the reputation of the entity. 
**ERI is the largest fully integrated IT and electronics asset disposition service provider in the U.S. and focused on data destruction and cybersecurity** – ERI is the only company in the world with NAID AAA and e-Stewards certifications. NAID is the only recognized certification focused exclusively on data security and data destruction; e-Stewards addresses both data security and environmental controls. Holding these certifications means we are subject to audit more than our clients with 15 to 20 audits every year, including unannounced audits. 
We can service clients throughout the country through our eight locations. Further, ERI offers a recycling kit program to handle smaller volumes responsibly and cost effectively for local government and state agencies. 
**ERI specializes in state and local government e-recycling and data destruction** – Collection events, school systems at all levels, box programs, on-site shredding, asset resale and more – we know government. 
We 100% guarantee you and your citizen’s data will be wiped from any IT and electronic assets if you use ERI. Further, there is a 100% guarantee that your assets won’t end up in a landfill anywhere in the world preventing public damage to your reputation and costly fines or cleanup costs.

# Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI)
Data center decommissioning, corporate IT asset refreshes, mobile devices, network equipment, serialized box programs, on-site shredding, asset resale and more – we know BFSI. 
[ Speak To An ERI Expert ](https://eridirect.com/contact-us)
### The Challenge
The Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector encompasses commercial banks, credit unions, cooperatives, retail financial services, payment gateways, brokers, and other financial entities. 
It is common for IT service providers to refer to the BFSI industry due to requirements that apply to all sectors. ERI does so for the same reason – data destruction requirements are effectively identical across all sectors of BFSI. 
All BFSI organizations are mandated to comply with the myriad of data protection and disposal requirements including some combination of The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), The Fair and Accurate Credit & Transaction Act (FACTA), The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), other Federal regulations, as well as state laws including The California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) and New York 23 NYCRR 500. 
In addition to regulatory compliance, the BFSI industry is built on trust. As BFSI organizations refresh IT hardware, decommission data centers, phone systems, mobile devices or replace ATM equipment, data can remain on those devices. Unless those devices are data sanitized or destroyed properly, customer and proprietary data may still be present, especially if ineffective means such as primitive physical destruction methods are used. This exposes the organization to the potential for a costly data breach and reputation damage. 
The environmental issues are equally significant for every organization. E-waste only comprises 3% of the waste stream to landfills, yet accounts for 70% of the toxic substances found in landfills, including lead and mercury. Worse yet, much of the domestically generated e-waste is shipped to developing countries where it is processed unsafely exposing communities, especially children, to extremely high levels of hazardous substances. An institutional brand tied to discovery of its electronics in developing countries could be catastrophic. 
### Protect your Organization
The issue is twofold: A BFSI organization must meet the challenge of both protecting customer data contained in end-of-life equipment while also ensuring both data and non-data bearing electronics equipment are properly recycled to comply with all applicable regulations and to protect the reputation of the institution. 
**ERI is the largest fully integrated IT and electronics asset disposition service provider in the U.S. and focused on data destruction and cybersecurity** – ERI is the only company in the world with NAID AAA and e-Stewards certifications. NAID is the only recognized certification focused exclusively on data security and data destruction; e-Stewards addresses both data security and environmental controls. Holding these certifications means we are subject to audit more than our BFSI clients with 15 to 20 audits every year, including unannounced audits. 
BFSI clients need wide geographic coverage typically due to a wide geographic dispersion of locations. We can service clients throughout the country through our eight locations. Further, ERI can process more than typical IT assets such as ATMs, VOIP phone systems, and a wide range of mobile devices. 
**ERI specializes in BFSI** – Data center decommissioning, corporate IT asset refreshes, mobile devices, network equipment, serialized box programs, onsite shredding, asset resale and more – we know BFSI. 
We 100% guarantee you and your customer’s data will be wiped from any IT and electronic assets if you use ERI. Further, there is a 100% guarantee that your assets won’t end up in a landfill anywhere in the world preventing public damage to your reputation. 
ERI provides comprehensive data destruction and electronics recycling services with a defensible “audit trail.” This enables you to demonstrate compliance with all requirements for data destruction under the applicable FISMA, GLBA, FACTA, and PCI requirements as well as for environmental compliance.

# Healthcare
ERI safeguards organizations, people and the environment by ensuring full compliance with all applicable regulations for healthcare organizations. 
[ Speak To An ERI Expert ](https://eridirect.com/contact-us)
### The Challenge
All healthcare providers are mandated to comply with the myriad of both environmental and data protection requirements including The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH), The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), state and local laws, as well as possibly the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). 
HIPAA’s “Final Security Rule” requires the safeguarding and destruction of any Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) residing on legacy equipment or electronic health records (EHRs) being upgraded or taken out of service. 
As healthcare organizations refresh hardware, equipment, and EHRs, ePHI can remain on a wide variety of devices including computers, mobile devices, copiers, printers, and imaging equipment. Unless those devices are data sanitized properly, ePHI may still be present, especially if ineffective means such as primitive physical destruction methods are used. This exposes the organization to the potential for a costly data breach and reputation damage. 
Most people responsible for healthcare compliance are aware of the healthcare provider that had 57 hard drives stolen from a storage closet resulting in a $1.5M HHS settlement and almost $17 million in costs to investigate, remediate, and achieve adequate controls. What if those hard drives were found in a landfill? Reused in a computer and resold without the data being sanitized completely? Would the cost impact be any different? The related facet of asset disposition is the responsible disposal of non-data bearing electronic devices such as pulse oximeters, glucose monitors, MRI equipment and televisions, as well as general e-waste. 
However, it is about more than just the potential civil and criminal penalties for improper disposal. The healthcare community should be especially concerned about recycling practices since e-waste only comprises 3% of the waste stream to landfills, yet accounts for 70% of the toxic substances found in landfills, including lead and mercury. Worse yet, much of the domestically generated e-waste is shipped to developing countries where it is processed unsafely exposing communities, especially children, to extremely high levels of hazardous substances. 
### Protect your Organization
The issue is twofold: An organization must meet the challenge of both protecting ePHI contained in end-of-life equipment while also ensuring both data and non-data bearing electronics equipment is properly recycled to comply with all applicable regulations and to protect the reputation of the organization. 
ERI safeguards organizations, people and the environment by ensuring full compliance with all applicable regulations for healthcare organizations. As the largest fully integrated IT and electronic asset disposition provider in the United States, we have a nationwide solution while maintaining the highest certifications for both data destruction (NAID) and responsible recycling at all our facilities. 
ERI provides comprehensive data destruction and electronics recycling services with a defensible “audit trail.” This enables organizations to demonstrate compliance with all requirements for data destruction under the applicable healthcare regulations as well as for environmental compliance. 
Choosing ERI is the best way to safeguard your organization for IT and electronic asset disposition. However, if you choose to use other providers, please ensure that they are certified – it may even be a HIPAA violation if you don’t.

# Retail
Retailers need wide geographic coverage typically tied to distribution centers and a wide geographic dispersion of locations. We can service retailers throughout the country through our nine locations. 
[ Speak To A Retail Specialist ](https://eridirect.com/contact-us)
### The Challenge
All retailers are mandated to comply with the myriad of both environmental and data protection requirements including the **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard** (PCI DSS). 
75% of U.S. retailers have had a data breach, half in the last year. Dozens of retailers have been fined for environmental violations over the last few years. 
As retail organizations refresh hardware, data can remain on a wide variety of devices including computers, mobile devices, copiers, printers, and POS devices. Unless those devices are data sanitized or destroyed properly, customer and proprietary data may still be present, especially if ineffective means such as primitive physical destruction methods are used. This exposes the retailer to the potential for a costly data breach and reputation damage. 
The environmental issues are equally significant for retailers. E-waste only comprises 3% of the waste stream to landfills, yet accounts for 70% of the toxic substances found in landfills, including lead and mercury. Worse yet, much of the domestically generated e-waste is shipped to developing countries where it is processed unsafely exposing communities, especially children, to extremely high levels of hazardous substances. A retailer’s brand tied to discovery of its electronics in developing countries can be catastrophic. 
Choosing ERI is the best way to safeguard your organization for IT and electronic asset disposition. For more information on how ERI can help your organization as we have our other retail clients, or for a free assessment of your compliance with applicable regulations, please talk to a representative. 
[ Talk To A Representative ](https://eridirect.com/contact-us)
### Protect your Organization
The issue is twofold: A retailer must meet the challenge of both protecting customer data contained in end-of-life equipment while also ensuring both data and non-data bearing electronics equipment are properly recycled to comply with all applicable regulations and to protect the reputation of the retailer. 
**ERI is the largest fully integrated IT and electronics asset disposition service provider in the U.S.** – retailers need wide geographic coverage typically tied to distribution centers and a wide geographic dispersion of locations. We can service retailers throughout the country through our eight locations. Retailers have a wider range of IT and electronic assets than many other industries, so we can meet the needs of retailers better than our competitors. Self-checkout equipment, POS devices, scanners, mobile devices, and the wide range of electronic product returns all are within the capabilities of ERI to process and recycle. 
**ERI specializes in retail** – Reverse logistics, corporate IT asset refreshes, Point of Sale (POS) device refreshes, product recalls, take back recycling programs, retailers as resellers, box programs, asset resale and more – we know retail. 
We 100% guarantee that there won’t be any chance of an environmental fine or public damage to your reputation and a 100% guarantee you and your customer’s data will be wiped from any IT and electronic assets if you use ERI. 
ERI also provides comprehensive data destruction and electronics recycling services with a defensible “audit trail.” This enables you to demonstrate compliance with all requirements for data destruction under the applicable PCI requirements as well as for environmental compliance.

# Alkaline Battery Recycling and Management
All batteries are processed and recycled with state and federal laws compliance. 
[ Speak To A Battery Recycling Specialist ](https://eridirect.com/contact-us)
##  About Alkaline Battery Recycling Services 
Alkaline batteries are one of the most popular and widely used power sources in the United States, with billions of units being sold each year. These batteries are used to power many everyday devices from remote controls and flashlights, to smoke detectors and children’s toys, and various other household items. With the widespread usages of Alkaline batteries comes the responsibility to make sure that they are disposed of and recycled properly. 
Strategically located at ERI’s Indiana facility, ERI has the capacity to **process in-house millions of pounds of alkaline batteries per year.** Our recycling process breaks the battery down into it’s raw components — **steel, brass, paper and black mass** — and through our strategic and vetted downstream partners, we’re able to **recycle 100% of the battery.** ERI collects batteries nationwide at all our facilities for in-house recycling and processing and can receive batteries mixed or pre-sorted. 
Unlike rechargeable batteries, alkaline batteries are typically a single-use product. Meaning that once they run out of energy, they are often thrown away and end up in landfills, where they contribute to environmental pollution. Taking steps to properly recycle alkaline batteries not only prevents hazardous materials from seeping into the soil and water but also allows for the recovery of metals and other valuable materials that can be reused in the manufacturing process. 
ERI services are designed around the safe recovery, transportation and processing of alkaline and all types of batteries. These services include: 
  * End of life management services are designed for the recovery and handling of equipment and for the removal and recovery of batteries. 
  * Battery bins for collection of devices with batteries in offices, retail spaces, apartment buildings, and more to ensure proper collection and storage of devices with batteries. 
  * Manufacturer product recalls involving devices with batteries to develop retrieval methods are designed with the customer and our compliance team to ensure safe recovery of devices. 


Recycling alkaline batteries is a small but impactful way to protect our environment. ERI’s entire team, including the logistics and processing teams, all undergo specialized training in the proper handling and storage of batteries. ERI also implements a variety of processes and procedures, including the use of specialized technology, to prevent and limit fires related to battery handling and storage. All batteries are processed and recycled with state and federal laws compliance. 
ERI is the largest fully integrated Electronics & IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) provider and cybersecurity-focused hardware destruction company in the United States.

## Data Center Services
When services are required in your data center, whether it be data destruction, rack removal, consolidation, relocation, or a full data center decommissioning, ERI has the experience and expertise necessary to ensure the process is done in a secure, responsible, environmentally friendly, and efficient manner. As your data center service partner, ERI will ensure these five critical requirements are met: 
  * Data Security

  * Traceability


We offer a full range of services to provide you the safe removal and disposal of equipment. Services include decommissioning, on-site data eradication, data destruction services, and IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) services. ERI also offers relocation services for data centers and handles all aspects of the transfer including secure logistics. 
Mismanagement of data center equipment and the data which is stored on it poses substantial security risks, potential fines, and massive damage to your brand’s reputation. 
ERI’s center decommissioning team consists of dedicated account technicians who are specifically trained and experienced in data center environments, along with a full team of on-site engineers and specially trained logistics professionals, all of whom ensure secure efficient decommissioning services are provided. ERI’s data center services adhere to all ISO 9001, e-Stewards, and NAID procedures. 
ERI’s data center decommissioning services are specifically designed to help you achieve 100% compliance, reduce risk, minimize environmental impacts, and maximize the value recovered from retired assets – most importantly all while preventing any disruption to your day to day business operations.

Comprehensive Security Compliance 
##  Service Tiers for Enterprise-Grade Data Destruction 
####  Standard Data Destruction 
Data security is foundational to our operations. ERI is the trusted partner for Fortune 500 enterprises and government entities alike, independently audited and certified by NAID. Our data destruction process includes serialization of the data-bearing assets and the sanitization or physical destruction of media in accordance with NIST 800-88 Rev1. This widely adopted standard ensures all electronic waste data destruction is compliant, efficient, and secure. 
####  Enhanced Data Destruction 
For organizations requiring enhanced e-waste data destruction, ERI offers upgraded services including multiple pass wiping and/or media shredding. These services can be performed on-site or at ERI’s secure facilities. Full chain of custody is maintained throughout, supported by TSA-certified drivers, tamper-proof lock boxes, and optional video-verifiable data destruction, all within NAID-certified protocols. In addition, our Optech™ Capture™ technology allows for on-site serialization prior to secure transport to an ERI facility, providing a fully digital true chain of custody from the moment a device is picked up to its final disposition at ERI. 
####  High Security Observed Data Destruction 
Our highest level of data destruction service includes customer-escorted destruction loads, on-site observation, and strict compliance with NSA/CSS Policy Statement 9-12 for storage device sanitization. Highly trained security personnel oversee the progress to align with your specific compliance mandates for electronic waste data destruction. 
####  On-Site Shredding and Data Destruction 
Organizations demanding immediate and observable destruction benefit from ERI’s on-site e-waste data destruction services. Our fleet is equipped for physical shredding with full chain of custody and auditable traceability, guaranteeing enterprise-grade security directly at your location. 
####  Government & Defense Demilitarization Services 
Specialized data destruction for government agencies and contractors includes on-site processing in restricted environments with oversight from both client representatives and federal agents. ERI is authorized to sanitize, destroy, and recycle assets up to TOP SECRET classification under NSA/CSS Storage Device Sanitization guidelines. This service aligns with advanced electronic waste data destruction and regulatory mandates. 
Comprehensive Facility Security 
##  Facility-Wide Physical Security Measures 
ERI maintains strict security controls and protocols at all eight of our facilities including: 
  * 24/7 independent guarding of each facility
  * Fenced and gate perimeters
  * Video surveillance of all main areas and entry points 24/7
  * Third-party monitored security and alarm system including motion detection
  * Metal detector for floor ingress and egress
  * Facial recognition technology for access to our secure processing areas


  * Secured Asset Management and Data Destruction Zones with entry for authorized personnel only
  * Metal detector wands and RFID card and Proxy Ready entry/exit for secured areas
  * Folding security gates on door, loading dock doors and trucks containing material backed into loading docks
  * Government-level security measures for high-risk e-waste data destruction


Legacy Standard Clarification 
##  Clarification on DoD 5220.22-M “Standard” 
![Seal of the Department of Defense](https://eridirect.com/wp-content/themes/eri/assets/img/logo-department-of-defense.svg)
ERI frequently fields inquiries regarding DOD 5220.22-M. It’s important to clarify that this is not a current data sanitization standard, but rather a legacy overwrite method first referenced in 1995. The industry now aligns with NIST 800-88 Rev1 as the regulatory benchmark for electronic waste data destruction. However, ERI remains fully capable of executing both three-pass and seven-pass overwriting methods upon request.

# Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling
All batteries are processed and recycled with state and federal laws compliance. 
[ Speak To A Battery Recycling Specialist ](https://eridirect.com/contact-us)
##  About Battery Recycling Services 
There are nearly 3 billion dry-cell batteries purchased in the US, annually. Some of the largest EV produces are expected to consume more than 4 billion Li-ion cells in 2020. While this shift towards high-capacity batteries to power devices including electronics, vehicles, and more is much more sustainable, it poses a challenge once the batteries reach end of life and need to be recycled. 
With the continued growth of electronic devices and the desire for portability, the demand for batteries of all shapes and sizes continues. From portable powers tools, computers, mobile phones, household devices to cars, trucks and power supply units in facility management. 
Batteries vary in size from a button to a unit weighing of hundreds of pounds. They also have different compositions, which can include Lithium-ion (Li-ion), alkaline, carbon zinc, lead acid gel, and lithium batteries. 
ERI services are designed around the safe recovery, transportation and processing of all types of batteries. These services include: 
  * Manufacturer product recalls involving devices with batteries to develop retrieval methods are designed with the customer and our compliance team to ensure safe recovery of devices. 
  * Battery bins for collection of devices with batteries in offices, retail spaces, apartment buildings, and more to ensure proper collection and storage of devices with batteries. 
  * End of life management services are designed for the recovery and handling of equipment and for the removal and recovery of batteries. 


ERI’s entire team, including the logistics and processing teams, all undergo specialized training in the proper handling and storage of batteries. ERI also implements a variety of processes and procedures, including the use of specialized technology, to prevent and limit fires related to battery handling and storage. All batteries are processed and recycled with state and federal laws compliance. 
ERI is the largest fully integrated Electronics & IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) provider and cybersecurity-focused hardware destruction company in the United States.

In addition, ERI will implemenent physical cleaning of the device, labeling, label removal, and repair management for the devices to ensure they receive the highest return value possible. ERI will also data sanitize the devices, ensuring all data is erased and removed in accordance with NAID standards. Lease return services are carried out to meet the specific requirements of each customer’s lease return agreement. 
ERI also offers a full suite of reports to track the assets from the moment they are collected to final disposition and handoff to the lease company.

# Electronics Recycling Services
As the largest electronic recycling and fully integrated IT and electronics asset disposition provider in the United States, our mission is simple: protect people, the planet, and privacy. 
[ Speak To A Recycling Specialist ](https://eridirect.com/contact-us)
##  Understanding E-Waste 
**ERI takes the global challenge of electronic waste seriously.** As one of the leading e-waste companies, we offer comprehensive electronic recycling services that handle every phase of the recycling process. With the capacity to responsibly recycle up to one billion pounds of electronics annually, we operate at a scale and standard that is unmatched in the electronic recycling industry. 
ERI is uniquely positioned in the industry as both an electronic recycling provider as well as IT asset disposition company. This means your devices can be sorted, graded and the value which they contain maximized all under one roof. No longer do you need to send devices with value and without value to separate electronic recyclers, ERI handles it all under one roof saving you time and money. Our corporate electronic recycling program simplifies operations for organizations of all sizes, from small businesses to enterprise-level operations. We also offer specialized end of life hardware destruction services to ensure data security compliance and environmental integrity. 
Electronic waste, or e-waste, is the byproduct of our rapidly advancing digital age. It includes outdated, broken, or surplus electronic devices that can no longer be reused. Without proper handling by certified electronic recyclers or reputable e-waste companies, these items pose serious environmental risks due to the hazardous materials they contain. 
As a leading electronic recycling provider, ERI is committed to making sure that e-waste is not just disposed of but transformed or given new life. Through our electronic recycling services, we recover valuable materials such as metals, plastics, and glass, we help reintroduce these commodities into the manufacturing lifecycle. Our efforts in national electronic recycling reduce demand for new resources and minimizing the impact on the environment. ERI creates a truly circular economy working with our integrated downstream partners and OEMs on giving new life to the commodities produced by old electronics. We are proud to also support local electronic recycling initiatives to guarantee accessibility to responsible disposal services in every community.

##  Creating True Chain-of-Custody 
**In 2023, ERI redefined the meaning of chain-of-custody with the launch of Optech™ Capture™, a mobile scanning solution powered by ERI’s proprietary AI driven SOAR technology.**
When deployed in the field, Optech™ Capture™ enables ERI and its logistics network to scan and serialize IT assets at the point of pickup, creating the industry’s only true digital chain of custody of every single asset from the moment it is scanned, photographed and inventoried at pick up all the way to its final disposition within an ERI facility. This ensures every device; every time is accounted for both from a financial perspective but more importantly from a data destruction standpoint. 
These capabilities are further reinforced by SOAR™, ERI’s proprietary AI platform for asset intake and serialization. SOAR™ applies artificial intelligence and ERI’s proprietary world leading catalog of 36,000+ asset profiles to facilitate rapid and precise intake of devices at ERI and our partner locations. 
![Screenshots of Optech and Optech Capture](https://eridirect.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/optech-and-capture-screenshots.png)
The most recent advancement, SOAR™ 3, expands on earlier versions with the integration of advanced robotics and automation: 
  * **High-resolution robotic cameras and 3D scanning tunnels** resulting in 100% accurate device serialization and photographic evidence of device receipt and condition 
  * **Intelligent feeder belts and smart routing systems** to more efficiently route devices through ERI’s facilities resulting in faster processing times and strict adherence to SLAs 
  * **Automated weight measurement and asset tag printing** allowing devices to be fully tracked in real time while they are being processed within ERI’s facilities 


Together, these features enable complete automation of asset intake, sorting, serialization, and routing workflows. The system feeds this data directly into Optech™, allowing for synchronized and autonomous operations across ERI facilities and unparalleled customer transparency into the entire process.

# Logistics
ERI can provide both national and international logistics support through several services to meet an organization’s needs. 
[ Speak To A Logistics Expert ](https://eridirect.com/contact-us)
ERI can provide both national and international logistics support through several services to meet an organization’s needs including full truck load (FTL) and less than truckload (LTL) pickups, “white glove” services, and in certain areas deployment of ERI patented secure locked bins (U.S. Patent 9365227) or secure hard drive containers. 
The safest and most secure method for collecting and storing electronics includes securing items on pallets by shrink wrapping stackable electronics onto pallets and packing mixed e-scrap into lined Gaylord boxes placed on pallets. 
If an organization cannot segregate and package material prior to carrier arrival, ERI will provide our turnkey White Glove Service (WGS). Packaging and logistics service and is available for both small and large quantity pickups. With the WGS service, ERI will package, palletize, shrink wrap and provide padded pick-up service if desired. Material is transported to the nearest ERI facility for in-house processing. 
Assets are picked up when scheduled through ERI’s robust tracking and asset management portal, Optech™. 
In addition to our own transportation fleet, ERI uses third-party logistics and asset-based carriers nationwide. ERI will track each driver through the DOT’s “SAFER” (Safety and Fitness Electronic Records) system, which tracks all carriers’ accidents, mechanical failures, highway scale inspection results, and drug testing for operators. When possible, ERI uses carriers who are SmartWay Certified, which is a certification showing that the carrier has taken sufficient steps and provided evidence in efforts to reduce their overall carbon footprint. Our third-party logistics do the same rigorous background and security checks during the on-boarding steps process as ERI. 
###  Trailer Staging 
ERI recognizes that some clients have limited space for the storage and consolidation of electronic devices. One of the many solutions ERI offers is the placement of a trailer in which electronics can be consolidated for shipment. 
ERI can stage a trailer at the client’s choice of location where the client can load properly packaged electronics into the trailer. When the trailer is full, ERI can remove the full trailer from the site and replace with an empty trailer to provide seamless collection of electronics for recycling. 
![Photo of a semi trailer](https://eridirect.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/semi-trailer.jpg)
ERI is the largest fully integrated Electronics & IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) provider and cybersecurity-focused hardware destruction company in the United States.

# On-Site Shredding
Instead of sending IT assets to ERI’s facility, clients can request that one of our secure electronic destruction vehicles come to their location. 
[ Speak To An ERI Expert ](https://eridirect.com/contact-us)
Many clients prefer or require having their IT assets destroyed on-site as opposed to sending them to our facility for destruction. Fortunately, this is possible thanks to ERI’s fleet of electronic destruction vehicles. 
###  **How On-Site Shredding Works**
Instead of sending IT assets to ERI’s facility, clients can request that one of our secure electronic destruction vehicles come to their location. These vehicles are equipped to handle the destruction of hard drives, cell phones, computers, tapes, CDs, and other electronic equipment. 
ERI can also provide clients with a secure data bin that can be used to collect any assets that need to be destroyed. The steel-plated bin can be locked to keep all of the assets safe until our destruction vehicle arrives. 
Once we arrive, the IT assets will be taken inside the truck, where our professionals will be counted or serialized. The serial numbers on each device will be recorded before the device is shredded. This allows clients to keep track of their assets even after they have been destroyed. Clients will also receive certificates of destruction for each IT asset so they have a record of everything that has been destroyed. 
Since the assets are destroyed inside the vehicle, clients can have keep a watchful eye on their assets throughout the process to ensure the destruction is done properly. After the process is complete, the shredded materials will be transported to an ERI facility. Our team will then remove aluminum, glass, metals and other recyclables from the shredded materials. 
###  **The Security of On-Site Shredding**
Many clients worry that the data on their IT assets will somehow be compromised while the assets are being transported to a recycler for destruction. With on-site shredding, this should no longer be a concern since the assets are not moved from the client’s location until they are destroyed. 
The process that is used to shred IT assets within our vehicles meets or surpasses all U.S. government standards related to the destruction of sensitive data and IT assets. It also surpasses the data destruction standards established by the Department of Defense and the National Institute For Standards and Technology. Therefore, there’s no need to worry that the data will be compromised or retrievable after the device has been destroyed. 
In addition, all of ERI’s employees have been thoroughly trained to handle sensitive data. Each employee also has to pass rigorous background checks before they are hired at one of our facilities. The trustworthiness of our employees combined with our innovative destruction process should put our clients’ minds at ease about the security of their sensitive data. 
###  **On-Site Shredding is Safe For the Environment**
Destroying old IT assets through on-site shredding is also environmentally friendly. Unlike other e-waste recyclers, we do not use harmful chemicals at any point in the data destruction or shredding process. As a result, shredding IT assets inside our trucks is not harmful to the environment or people. The shredded materials are also completely recyclable, which means nothing that is shredded in our vehicles will end up sitting in a landfill. 
###  **On-Site Data Erasure Services**
ERI also offers several on-site data erasure services that may be of interest to our clients. First, clients can request that our team erase data on their devices. The device would remain in the client’s possession after the data has been erased so it can be reused internally or resold. ERI also offers data erasure services for employees who are working remotely. A bootable USB drive can be created that gives the remote employee the power to wipe the hard drive on their own. The USB drive will automatically create a detailed report that outlines each drive that the remote employee has destroyed. Once this report is retrieved, ERI will be able to provide a certificate of data destruction to the client. 
For more information on our on-site shredding, contact ERI at 1-800-ERI-DIRECT or request a quote by filling out the form on our website.

# PV Management / Solar Panel Recycling
ERI can safely recycle photovoltaic panels and equipment 
[ Speak To An ERI Specialist ](https://eridirect.com/contact-us)
ERI is able to safely recycle the following PV equipment: 
  * PV modules (mono or polycrystalline, shingle-type, etc.) 
  * Inverters or microinverters 
  * Racking equipment or trackers 


Recycling a solar panel can be broken down into three basic steps: 
  1. Remove the frame and junction box (a mechanical process) 
  2. Separate the glass from the silicon wafer (a thermal, mechanical or chemical process) 
  3. Separate and purify the silicon and various metals (a chemical and electrical process) 


Project end-of-life management services are designed for the recovery and handling of equipment and for the removal and recovery or large installation units. Our teams, from logistics through to processing, are specially trained to handle solar panels. 
Solar panel disposal must be more than throwing old PV modules, inverters, and wires into the trash. Solar panels contain items that can be reused and turned into new things. The best solar recycling program starts by understanding how solar panels are made. 
Whether you’re a homeowner with a photovoltaic solar panel array that is reaching end-of-life, or you’re a manufacturer who is looking at the best practices for recycling silicon solar panels, ERI is ready to help you with your recycling needs.

[ Speak To A Remarketing Specialist ](https://eridirect.com/contact-us)
ERI is committed to providing our clients with the highest value of return on capital asset investments. Through ERI’s Asset Recovery Program, ERI can identify, sanitize, test, refurbish and resell each device. ERI is focused on maximizing the value of not only intact, tested, and working devices. 
ERI’s asset management team specializes in complete asset refurbishment and resale including the following: 
  * #### Testing, Auditing and Tracking
Once equipment has been received and is centrally located, ERI will perform testing and auditing services to determine the usefulness of the item and to capture important tracking information from each major component. 
  * #### Data Security
Due to the sensitive information contained in almost all electronic memory components, ERI follows a stringent data management process to ensure that sensitive data is not inadvertently compromised. 
  * #### Valuation Process
ERI will determine current market conditions and identify equipment that can be resold at a fair and reasonable price. Part of the validation process includes a determination on what type of a return-on-investment can be achieved. 


ERI is the largest fully integrated Electronics & IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) provider and cybersecurity-focused hardware destruction company in the United States.

###  Spotlight on the Big Apple 
New York City is home to many of ERI’s banking and financial services clients that we support for data center services and IT asset disposition. However, ERI’s commitment to the community and programs for residents goes above and beyond typical services. 
ERI teamed with Best Buy and The Clubhouse Network to develop the first Best Buy Teen Tech Center in New York City at the Brooklyn Public Library (BPL). The new center includes a variety of workstations, a music studio and other state-of-the-art technology to help teens see the possibilities for future careers in the high-tech sector. ERI is co-funding this community project. 
How does New York City meet the challenge of electronics collection for residents in a city jam packed with apartment buildings? Through ERI of course! ERI collects most consumer electronics for recycling in New York City through deployment of ERI’s patented e-recycling bins in over 5,000 locations throughout New York City. Every day, ERI deploys a dozen trucks on collection routes throughout the boroughs to meet the challenge of e-recycling in the largest city in the United States. 
ERI is the largest fully integrated Electronics & IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) provider and cybersecurity-focused hardware destruction company in the United States.

# Circularity and Compliance Services
Compliance and circularity programs for consumer electronics producers, retailers, and collectors. 
[ Speak To An OEM Compliance Specialist ](https://eridirect.com/contact-us)
ERI is a trusted partner to more of the world’s leading consumer electronics producers, retailers, and collectors than any other ITAD, electronic recycling company, or service provider. For nearly 20 years, we’ve helped our partners navigate the complex world of compliance, offering nationwide support through our in-house Legislative Compliance team with experts on all the federal, state, provincial, and local e-waste regulation along with our footprint of nine facilities across the United States and beyond. Whether you’re working within regulatory programs or pursuing voluntary sustainability efforts, ERI provides a one-stop solution to give our partners full coverage in all 50 states and beyond with goal-oriented services. 
ERI has built our reputation by supporting producers, retailers, and collectors of all sizes with tailored compliance strategies. From Advanced Recovery Fee (ARF) states and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) programs to custom initiatives, we handle the heavy lifting so you can stay focused on your core business. Our role varies, sometimes we serve as the program administrator and other times as a behind-the-scenes partner helping to manage retail, nonprofit, and municipal collection channels. But the goal is always the same: to keep you compliant, informed, and ahead of the curve. 
Comprehensive Compliance Program 
##  What You Can Expect When Working with ERI 
We stay up to date on every state’s requirement and keep an eye on upcoming changes. Our team helps you understand exactly what’s needed in each state and makes sure you stay compliant, even as rules evolve. 
Through a mix of retail, government, nonprofit, mail-back, and private collection programs, we create flexible networks that work. Whether mandated or voluntary, our collection systems are designed to fit the needs of each state while keeping things efficient and cost-effective for you. 
Everything we handle is processed to the highest standard with no shortcuts. Our facilities meet rigorous sustainability and data security certifications, as well as all applicable local and state regulations. 
ERI is the only Legislative compliance provider with downstream partners who are fully integrated with our operations. We audit each one regularly to make sure they’re doing everything right and meeting the same high standard we set for ourselves. 
With eight locations across the country and state-of-the-art AI equipped logistics networks, we optimize the entire logistics process to keep transportation costs down and minimize environmental impact. It’s one of the many ways our scale works to your advantage. 
Our proprietary technology platform, Optech™, allows us to connect our collection network to producers by state and material ensuring full compliance in each program. No surprises. No guesswork. 
We make reporting easy and accurate. ERI can manage reporting to the states on your behalf or provide you with all the data you need to report directly. Through your dedicated relationship manager, you’ll always have the data you need at your fingertips. 
Some states require public education, and we’ve got you covered. But we also go beyond the basics, helping our partners roll out nationwide or targeted voluntary programs, implement EPEAT standards, Circular Transitions Indicators, THESIS reporting, and gain public recognition for their efforts. 
Whether it is voluntary or mandated recalls, ERI can support the collection and processing of recalled products including those with potentially volatile batteries. Our recall services can include reverse logistics, tracking services, customized packaging meeting regulatory transport requirements, customizable consumer facing website with recall or mail-in return options, Itemized reporting, In-house certified destruction, onsite witnessed destruction. 
ERI can set up a customized mail-in collection program to allow customers to return products for recycling and/or trade-in. Can be used for compliance, additional EPEAT points, or for other ESG or Circularity initiatives. This service can include your brands or include collection of all brands. Can be limited by product types, states or regions, or by weight restrictions. If required or requested, we can provide consumer packaging and direct pickup of bulky items. 
The System is customizable to use ERI’s or clients courier accounts, utilizing our eight nationwide facilities and network of global partners, shipping costs and carbon footprint are much lower than single facility providers. 
On a large or small scale, ERI has various opportunities to support brands in their efforts including collection bins or events at company offices, company branded or sponsored collection events, and distribution of company coupons at ERI’s existing collection network locations and events. 
ERI has worked with major brands on a range of Design and Circularity services including warranty services, recycled material sourcing for circular manufacturing, and facility tour and discussion for product design team.

# Verification of Service Providers
Over 134 IT and Electronics recycling facilities have been fined, abandoned, had certifications suspended/revoked, or have been caught exporting to developing countries in Africa and Asia. Such events can be disastrous to your reputation and can result in your organization incurring fines or potentially the additional cost of disposal or cleanup. Those are not just theoretical outcomes – some of the most prestigious companies in the world have had to incur significant additional cost and scramble to address a large provider’s bankruptcy in 2018; well-known organizations have had their brand tied to scandals involving exporting e-waste to developing countries; and numerous local governments are currently embroiled in litigation over clean-up costs from abandoned e-waste by disreputable recyclers. Are any of those risks worth saving a few pennies per pound on electronics recycling? 
The following resources are provided to allow you to verify that we are who we say we are and to make an informed decision regarding other providers. 
![](https://eridirect.com/wp-content/themes/eri/assets/img/logo-basel-action-network.svg)
Make sure your current or future service provider is not one called out in the [Basel Action Network (BAN) “Scam Recycling” reports](http://www.ban.org/trash-transparency/) for exporting to developing nations. 
![](https://eridirect.com/wp-content/themes/eri/assets/img/logo-e-stewards.svg)
Verify a provider’s [e-Stewards certification.](http://e-stewards.org/find-a-recycler/)
![](https://eridirect.com/wp-content/themes/eri/assets/img/logo-naid.svg)
There is a big difference between being a NAID organization member and going through the rigorous process to become NAID AAA certified. You can [verify a provider online at NAID's website](https://directory.naidonline.org/). Be sure to filter for Certified members only and for Computer Media Destruction, both physical and sanitization. 
Finally, you should make sure your provider isn’t affiliated with any [non-compliant manufacturers.](https://www.ecycleclearinghouse.org/contentpage.aspx?pageid=105)
