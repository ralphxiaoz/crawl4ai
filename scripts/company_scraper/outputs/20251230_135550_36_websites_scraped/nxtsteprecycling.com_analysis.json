This is a major red flag for a potential B2B vendor, as it prevents any verification of their business model, inventory, certifications, or operational capabilities. Without this basic information, it is impossible to determine if they meet Yilong's critical requirements for enterprise IT asset volume, testing/grading, R2v3 certification, and wholesale sales channels. Attempting to proceed would be speculative and inefficient. The recommendation is to skip this vendor and focus on companies with transparent, accessible operations.",
