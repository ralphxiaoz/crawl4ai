The crawl covers multiple pages (Home, About, Contact, etc.).\n2. There is significant overlapping/duplicate information across these pages.\n3. You MUST consolidate all information into a SINGLE company profile.\n4. Do NOT output a list of companies. Extract exactly ONE company object.\n5.

It has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences of my life. What I'm most proud of is the culture we have created in which every individual has a shared commitment to growth, cross-functional collaboration and continuous development - both from a business and personal perspective. If this resonates with you we would love to have you join our team!\"\n#### Shelly Li, CEO\n“Sprout is a place where everyone has ‘grit’ and injects that energy into everything that we do. It’s not that hard to surround yourself with smart people. It’s not terribly hard to surround yourself with hard-working people. But to surround yourself with teammates who bring a ‘we will thrive’ mentality to each day, who always finds a way when others can’t, and who you can count on to give that extra 5% on every occasion… that’s special. That’s Sprout.”\n#### Brendan Farwick, Logistics and Service Delivery Manager\n\"Sprout is a vibrant company that empowers it's diverse workforce, and recognizes and values contributors at all levels. From the top down, everyone supports each other and works towards a mutual goal to better serve our customers, and our planet.\"\n#### Maintain Health\n  * Employer-paid healthcare insurance for the employee\n  * 2 medical plans for employees & their families\n  * Dental insurance\n#### Grow Finances\n  * 401K with company match\n  * Employer paid life insurance\n  * Voluntary life insurance\n#### Take Time\n  * 7 paid holidays\n  * 2 paid floating holidays\n  * PTO accrual on day one of full-time employment\n#### Learn & Develop\n  * Education reimbursement program\n  * Structured growth plans\n### **9/80 Schedule**\nHere at Sprout, we focus on work-life balance, which is why we have implemented the 9/80 schedule. This means you work 80 hours in 9 days, which allows our employees to have every other Friday off. Included in that we have no weekend work unless necessary, it gives our employees a 3-day weekend every other week, so they can be with their families more. It also gives them time to refresh and re-center, while completing tasks they would normally have to wait till the weekend to do.\n### Join Our Talent Community\nJoin our talent network and get Sprout news and job alerts delivered to your inbox.\nSee jobs by:\nCategories Locations\nCookies are used on this site to assist in continually improving the candidate experience and all the interaction data we store of our visitors is anonymous.

With destruction facilities strategically located across the world and a vetted transportation provider network, we are intimately familiar with the most effective ways to guarantee chain-of-custody as equipment moves from your locations to ours.\nDedicated, point-to-point transportation is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to securing your equipment while it is in transit.

Before opening the truck doors, Sprout will upload visual confirmation of the van trailer's intact & original seal to your portal. Then, during the unloading of the truck, our technicians will perform a 5-point inspection of each pallet, checking for any visible signs of tampering. Should there be any signs of tampering, all pallets on the shipment will be quarantined while your account manager escalates the information to you through the proper channels.\nOnce each pallet has been physically unloaded and successfully reconciled to your packing list, Sprout technicians will dive one level deeper. With a copy of your serialized equipment list, we scan each asset and compare it to each serial on your equipment list. Any and all inconsistencies will be escalated to you through your account manager so that your inventory management system is never inaccurate and your organization's security procedures are always followed.\n# URL: https://www.sproutup.com/certified-destruction-levels-1-3\n# Certified Destruction\nOn-Site Services\nSerial-Level Reconciliation\nDestruction Levels\nOn-Site Services\nSecure Shipping\nDisposition\nHigh-Security Storage\n# Overview\n#  Inside reverse logistics centers, your operational staff are forced to juggle multiple urgent and important tasks on a daily basis. Preparing equipment for destruction gets put on the backburner. Inventory buildup disables staff from operating efficiently, driving up cost for your organization. To eliminate this dilemma, Sprout can staff our specialized technicians on-site to execute destruction preparation processes alongside your existing staff.

Enterprises, as the largest users of electronic devices, have an opportunity to communicate their priorities clearly with a zero landfill recycling policy.\nAfter destruction, Sprout makes every attempt to ensure that Equipment will be dispositioned in a manner such that parts/components may be used again. Once we've made the determination that parts/components cannot be reused in any fashion, or if special requirements forbid its reuse, we begin the process of recycling.\nFirst, we break the equipment into smaller forms. Technicians de-manufacture the devices, shred the parts into tiny fractions, and then feed the output through various magnets, eddy currents, and even manual picking lines to create the cleanest possible finished goods.\nOur goal is to return these commodities to the raw materials supply chain as efficiently as possible. Steel to the steel mill, copper to the copper smelter, precious materials like gold and silver to their respective refineries, and plastics to be re-processed into new equipment.\nGet in touch with us to get a walk-through of our industry-disrupting sustainability scorecard.

They validate, barcode, and create records for each asset prior to deployment to a user or installation in a rack location unit (RLU). Throughout that asset's lifecycle, related service tickets are filed and updates are made so that chain-of-custody is maintained.\nDuring asset retirement, Sprout is able to perform equipment reconciliation at each transfer point to guarantee security and data integrity. During decommissioning, we inventory each asset by row, by rack, and by RLU. Before loading for off-site transfer, each pallet/rack contains a detailed inventory. At a Sprout facility, trained receiving specialists perform an asset-level inventory on each pallet/rack and reconcile the information against what was captured at your site. Only after we confirm an exact match do we allow your equipment to enter the processing area for work to be done.\nHow do we keep this robust process gated and well organized, you may ask? Unlike many industry providers, we don't just use an Excel spreadsheet or single database. Sprout can quickly deploy a bi-directional API from our proprietary system with nearly all web-based asset management, service desk management, and process workflow management software in order to give you the ability to verify our chain-of-custody practices in your own systems. Through this connection, we can, among other things to give you total peace of mind:\n# Update asset locations, states, and sub-states to provide asset-level statuses and lifecycle data\n# Highlight reconciliation mismatches (e.g. serialized asset not found, extra serialized assets)\n# Queue requests to remote management unlock and/or unenroll expected and successfully received equipment\n# URL: https://www.sproutup.com/lifecycle-optimization-omni-channel-monetization\n# Lifecycle Optimization\nOmni-Channel Monetization\nRedeployment\nEquipment Reconciliation\nOmni-Channel Monetization\nValue-Added Processing\nEmployee Buyback\nDonations\nTurnkey Logistics\nCustom Routing & Storage\nHigh-Security Quarantine\nZero Landfill Recycling\nOn-Site Services\n# Overview\n# Having resold $200M+ equipment to the secondary device market, no one understands how to achieve maximum value rapidly as well as Sprout. In fact, we have been known to consistently deliver monetization returns of up to 45% more than other industry providers. Let us manage the timing, the outlets, and the hundreds of other monetization nuances for you.\nSprout has established one of the highest quality direct-to-consumer brands in the industry, having achieved Power Seller status on eBay and being one of very few providers accepted into Amazon’s Renewed platform for refurbished IT hardware. These preferred channels help us achieve 70%+ higher returns on most equipment, including: switches, routers, desktop computers, monitors, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, memory, CPU, media devices, and all variations of consumer hardware and accessories.\nTo supplement our highly effective eCommerce monetization capability, Sprout maintains a vast network of value-added resellers (VARs) and managed service providers (MSPs) who use Sprout as their preferred fulfillment partner of secondary market equipment. Having developed long-standing relationships with the largest VARs and MSPs from the client to the cloud, we are able to resell high volumes of equipment for top dollar.\n# URL: https://www.sproutup.com/lifecycle-optimization-on-site-services\n# Lifecycle Optimization\nOn-Site Services\nRedeployment\nEquipment Reconciliation\nOmni-Channel Monetization\nValue-Added Processing\nEmployee Buyback\nOn-Site Services\nDonations\nTurnkey Logistics\nCustom Routing & Storage\nHigh-Security Quarantine\nZero Landfill Recycling\n# Overview\n# Inside major offices, IT depots, and data centers, your operational staff are forced to juggle multiple urgent and important tasks on a daily basis.

It's not simply erasure and diagnostics to us.To provide 100% assurance that your data is destroyed, Sprout uses several 3rd party tools, audited and validated regularly to ensure our security standards are met.\nFor assets that Sprout plans to remarket, Sprout uses Softhinks’ Deployment Suite to eradicate data from data-bearing devices. For mobile assets that Sprout plans to remarket, Sprout uses Futuredial’s Lean One Touch software/hardware solution to wipe information. Both software solutions administer an ADISA certified wipe that meets or exceeds the NIST-800-88R1 standards.\nFor standalone storage hardware (SATA and fiber channel HDDs, SSDs) that Sprout plans to remarket, Sprout uses Extreme Protocol Solutions’ XErase software solution, integrated with Octain hardware, to perform data erasure. For NVMe, Sprout uses laptop-deployed software WipeOS for destruction of data. XErase administers an ADISA certified wipe that meets or exceeds the NIST-800-88R1 and DoD 5220.22-M standards. WipeOS also meets or exceeds the NIST-800-88R1 and DoD 5220.22-M standards.\nFor media that either cannot be verified as erased or do not meet Sprout’s tech cut line for remarketing, Sprout will physically destroy the devices through shredding, crushing, or drilling.\nAll our data destruction technology and methods meet and exceed the standards of NIST-800-88R1.\nAfter producing a Certificate of Data Destruction, we test, grade, and triage equipment with your best interests in mind. And through our value-added processing, we maximize your asset's secondary lifecycle in a way that distinguishes us amongst our peers. We can:\n# Coordinate equipment for in-warranty repair or replacement\n# Screen, clean, and re-format out-of-warranty equipment for redeployment\n# Earmark equipment for donation to local communities, with Sprout taking on responsibilities of diagnostics, re-imaging, and warranty\n# URL: https://www.sproutup.com/operations-security\n#  Technology\nOperations & Security\nOperations & Security\nSourcing & Procurement\nAsset Management\nCorporate Responsibility\n# Overview\n# When it comes to decommissioning an office or data center, or performing asset recovery for a remote workforce, you need extensive project management expertise and at-your-fingertips tracking.

She has an instinct for connecting cross-functional priorities, anticipating what teams need next, and creating a structure that helps people move with confidence. Her work has already strengthened the way Sprout operates—quietly, consistently, and with a deep sense of purpose.\n“I’m thrilled to be joining Sprout full time and to contribute more directly to our 2026 priorities,” said Caroline. “Sprout’s values deeply resonate with how I approach work and collaboration. I’m grateful for the opportunity to support our teams and help drive the next chapter of Sprout’s growth alongside Shelly and the leadership team.”\nCaroline brings a multidimensional background spanning engineering, supply chain, operations, and organizational alignment. That combination gives her a systems-level perspective paired with the practical judgment needed to keep a growing organization aligned and moving forward.\nBut what resonates most is how closely her values mirror Sprout’s own. She believes in starting where you are, owning your strengths, and focusing on meaningful progress over rigid definitions of success. Her steady presence, her partnership-first mindset, and her ability to unblock others embody the humility, agility, and trust that define Sprout at its best.\nCEO Shelly Li shared her enthusiasm for Caroline’s transition: “Caroline has a way of bringing order to chaos and pressure into momentum. She’s become a steady, trusted force in our most important work. I’m deeply grateful to have her partnership and so excited for the impact she’ll help unlock across Sprout.”\nIn this new role, Caroline will work across leadership, operations, and strategic programs to support Sprout’s 2026 priorities, including deeper operational alignment, clearer processes, and systems that scale as quickly as our growth. Her focus is simple and essential:keep teams coordinated, informed, and moving with clarity. It’s work that rarely seeks the spotlight but always strengthens the foundation beneath it.\n# URL: https://www.sproutup.com/post/from-itad-provider-to-circular-supply-chain-partner-what-changed-and-why-it-matters\nSearch\nThe enterprise hardware landscape is changing fast. AI workloads, distributed systems, and constant refresh cycles are creating a demand for computing power—and a mountain of retired equipment. The question isn’t just how to dispose of those assets safely, but how to capture their remaining value.\nWith global IT hardware spending projected to grow _from $141.15 billion in 2025 to $206.05 billion_ by 2030, pressure is mounting to balance innovation with infrastructure spend and sustainability. This rapid trajectory is pushing organizations to uncover ways to recover the maximum value from their assets.\nSprout is redefining IT asset disposition (ITAD) for the world’s most tech-forward enterprises, modernizing how hardware value is tracked, recovered, and redeployed. As an emerging leader in circular supply chain management, Sprout brings a more intelligent approach centered on security, value creation, and sustainability.\nOur SmartERP (SERP) platform, a proprietary, technology-driven engine, connects systems, partners, and data in real time across every phase of the asset lifecycle, **driving up to 127% net recovery for resale alone, with additional savings realized through internal redeployment and reuse.**\nIt’s the core of our differentiation: **What used to be a compliance headache is now an opportunity for enterprises to reduce internal operating and capital costs.**\nThis article explores:\n  * Why traditional ITAD processes limit asset visibility, reuse, and long-term value.\n  * How a circular supply chain partner turns disposal into a continuous system of recovery and reinvestment.\n  * What residual value analysis means for the next era of sustainable, financially savvy infrastructure planning.\n  * Why Sprout is trusted by **more than 60% of the top S &P 500** technology and manufacturing enterprises.\n## The evolution of IT asset management\nWhen IT hardware reaches retirement, it typically means one thing: dispose of it safely and move on. But what if that phase could be the start of something more?\nFor years, ITAD has been the industry norm—a process focused on end-of-life, compliance, data wiping, and responsible disposition. The goal has been risk avoidance – a mindset that has a lot of shortcomings.\n**By having a circular supply chain partner,** enterprises are now realizing that what was once a purely compliance focus, can be expanded to include value creation and turning hardware decisions into levers for efficiency, sustainability, and financial return.\n**A circular supply chain partnership is an ecosystem for maximizing the full value and utility of IT assets.**\nInstead of a one-time transaction, circular lifecycle management is a flywheel that keeps assets and data in play to capture full value. As AI demand _strains compute capacity_ , what once seemed obsolete might now find a second life through redeployment, donation, or resale. Whatever the hardware’s next destination, the goal is the same—recover lifecycle value and redirect it into future infrastructure.\n## The old model is a transaction\nTraditional ITAD follows a fixed playbook: retire hardware, call a vendor, schedule a pickup, wipe data, sell what’s possible, move on. Once the transaction is closed, the relationship ends until the next refresh.\nThis transactional process measures success by completed deals, not outcomes. Every decommission adds new quotes, logistics, and paperwork with no shared visibility into which assets left, where they went, or what they were worth.\nToday’s demands expose the gaps, and those enterprises still juggling disconnected vendors and spreadsheets losing opportunities to redeploy, extract value, and reduce waste.\n## The new model is strategic lifecycle management\nWith rapid upgrades and vast device volumes, more enterprises are seeing the value of connecting every stage of their hardware into one continuous lifecycle. The idea is simple: When every asset stays accounted for, its remaining value can be measured, recovered, and reinvested.\nPartnering with a circular supply chain leader like Sprout gives your enterprise strategic control over what’s in use, what’s ready for refresh, and what can be reused, refurbished, or resold.\nOur SERP platform goes beyond traditional ITAD tools by linking enterprise systems, partners, and data into a single operational framework.\n**Rather than treating disposition as an endpoint, Sprout’s next-gen SERP architecture turns each stage of the hardware lifecycle into a value event—capturing, measuring, and reinvesting returns in real time.**\nThis continuous loop of visibility and optimization allows Sprout’s clients to achieve bottom line gains, not just from resale but also from smarter redeployment, utilization, and planning across an enterprise’s global supply chain.\n**Already, more than 60% of the top S &P 500 technology and manufacturing enterprises rely on Sprout’s circular supply chain network to manage IT hardware at scale.**\nBy syncing data from service ticketing and inventory systems, tracking real-time asset status worldwide, and producing audit-ready documentation, hardware heavy companies are turning operational complexity into actionable insight.\n## Residual value analysis is changing IT asset management\nResidual value used to be an accounting footnote. Now it’s central to budgeting, strategy, and IT investment decisions.\nThis approach looks beyond depreciation curves to ask: what might this hardware be worth after its primary role? Redeployment and resale can unlock substantially more value and strengthen the bottom line.\nEnterprises that embed residual value into lifecycle planning gain an edge by forecasting which assets to extend or refresh and using recovered value to fund new technology. In today’s market, this kind of insight helps organizations offset the reinvestment cost in updating and upgrading infrastructure.\n## The business impact of lifecycle visibility\nIT and procurement leaders often lack visibility into the value of their hardware. But where legacy systems and vendor silos block transparency, circular lifecycle management restores it.\nWhen technology integrates with existing enterprise systems to map every step of hardware life, teams see costs, risks, and rewards more clearly. Importantly, they also support ESG goals, sustainability reporting, and operational resilience.\nThe results speak for themselves.\n**Circular supply chain partnerships built on integrated models recover more value from existing assets, extend hardware life, and reduce waste.**\nThe need for this shift from a sustainability standpoint is also clear. The Digital Watch Observatory reports that only about _20% of global e-waste is recycled through formal channels_ , leaving most in landfills or informal waste streams. That gap is driving enterprises to embrace responsible asset management not only for long-term value, but also for compliance and reputation management.\nPut simply, companies that shift beyond one-off ITAD vendors toward circular supply chain partners gain continuous control, ongoing value recovery, and stronger long-term outcomes.\nWith its next-gen SERP architecture, Sprout’s _Lifecycle Services_ platform unites every phase of the asset lifecycle into a single ecosystem of visibility, value, and sustainable growth.\n_Discover_ how this next evolution in software can optimize your IT investment from day one through final recovery.\n# URL: https://www.sproutup.com/post/hidden-costs-of-ai-deployment-build-a-lifecycle-strategy-beyond-capex\nSearch\nEnterprise AI development is opening up a new era of innovation. It’s introducing capabilities that, until very recently, were unheard of. At the same time, it’s also introducing unprecedented infrastructure costs: GPUs, servers, storage arrays, laptops with embedded intelligence, energy-efficient power, and more. It’s enough capital expenditure (CapEx) to strain even well-funded budgets.\nAlready, data centers are multiplying to meet demand. A 2024 forecast from the International Energy Agency predicts _global electricity consumption will more than double_ in the coming years, from around 460 TWh in 2022 to over 1,000 TWh in 2026, driven by data centers, cryptocurrency, and AI.\nBut here’s the irony: while you’re chasing investors and allocating budgets, you may be sitting on millions of untapped value.\nThis article will answer:\n  * Why do legacy ITAD processes leave time, money, and resources on the table?\n  * What does it look like when IT budgets think beyond CapEx to fund ongoing AI innovation?\n  * How does an IT lifecycle hardware strategy—featuring a centralized platform with end-to-end services—enable enterprises to refresh at top speed and recoup investments?\n  * What makes Sprout the only tech solution built to support a circular IT supply chain?\n## AI infrastructure is more than a CapEx line item\nIT and procurement leaders with a traditional mindset think that managing AI infrastructure comes down to buying and replacing hardware. But that’s not the whole story. To make the most of every dollar, their perspective needs to move beyond simple IT asset disposition (ITAD) and toward a full lifecycle strategy for their AI hardware.\nWhat happens when you don’t see the fuller picture? When you simply schedule decommissioning and disposal with a vendor and consider the job done? You’re leaving money on the table from data center servers, employee laptops, storage arrays, and more, and also introducing risk.\n**Pitfall 1:** Traditional ITAD is usually managed on spreadsheets, with records trapped in Excel and approvals emailed between departments. There’s no visibility and manual errors introduce risks that can run into the six figures. Meanwhile, sensitive drives linger in warehouses for pickup, and assets get shipped off with little thought or insight into what comes next.\nIt’s slow and fragmented. But the problems go even deeper.\n**Pitfall 2:** When infrastructure management is limited to outsourced disposal and data destruction, department directors don’t see how much velocity, focus, and potential revenue is really being lost:\n  * **Missed cost-savings:** Without coordinated tracking, on-site decommissioning, and end-of-life optimization, valuable servers depreciate in storage. This erases millions of potential savings that could be earned through value recovery, refurbishment, or redeployment. When there’s no on-site option, shipping off-site to a vendor also comes with additional transport, storage, and staging costs.\n  * **Wasted valuable time:** A scattered process—built on email back-and-forths and manual logistics—increases the risk of downtime between refreshes. It also traps IT, finance, and procurement teams in dreaded menial tasks. Instead of working on high-impact tasks in the AI race, your teams lose hours chasing statuses; updating spreadsheets, coordinating transport, and inventorying, tagging, and prepping equipment.\n  * **Compliance risks and blind spots:** No centralized oversight means assets can slip through the cracks, and directors have only a vague idea of how much the process is costing them in dollars, talent, and emissions. Tracking is inconsistent and time-consuming, and compliance with environmental regulations is nearly impossible to verify.\nNet-net? Assets that could be recovered or refurbished sit idle and depreciate. What should be a strategic lever of the company becomes another cost center.\n## How an AI lifecycle strategy converts IT cost centers into growth engines\nSome enterprises have already solved the cost spiral, stopping IT assets from collecting dust in decommissioning queues. And it isn’t because they’re working harder. It’s because they have a **circular supply chain strategy for their hardware** , not scattered vendors.\nThe market’s only tech-first solution, Sprout partners with the world’s leading enterprises to make aging hardware more resilient—and uncover hidden savings. Backed by a purpose-built platform and an enterprise specialty, Sprout stands alone in turning hardware disposal into a data-driven edge.\nThrough Sprout partnerships, strategic data center and end-user device retirement has already **unlocked**** _over $1 million_** for a client in the automotive industry, and **$2 million** for a global fintech firm.\nWith this recovered value, these companies can fund data center operations, relocations, maintenance, equipment purchases, and more—without touching their CapEx or OpEx budgets.\nA combination of professional on-site services and digital-native platform embedded with AI, lets you centralize and have full visibility into your IT asset lifecycle.\nWith **over $2 billion assets processed** and **200+ enterprise clients** , Sprout helps companies across the globe have the best of both worlds: efficient, secure disposal and a revenue stream to fund AI transformations.

Today, we’re spotlighting Michael Smith, a leader whose creativity, initiative, and unwavering commitment to sustainability have shaped some of Sprout’s most impactful programs.\nMichael joined Sprout at a pivotal moment, when the company was still young, and its eCommerce presence hadn’t been built yet. Instead of seeing the gap as a challenge, he saw it as an opportunity.\n“When I first learned about Sprout, it was a young company without an established eCommerce presence, which I saw as an exciting challenge,” he says. “With my background in ITAD, I knew we could build that function from the ground up and maximize the reuse value of products while expanding Sprout’s reach.”\nWhat resonated with him immediately was Sprout’s commitment to sustainability and reuse. “I’ve always been passionate about environmental sustainability, and I loved that Sprout focused on reusing and reselling electronics rather than simply recycling them. Giving products a second life while benefiting both the planet and our customers really resonated with me.”\nMichael has worn several hats since joining Sprout, from General Manager to Sales Executive to Senior Manager of eCommerce. What keeps him excited? The pace of innovation.\n“ITAD is still a relatively new and evolving industry. We’re not just following a playbook; we’re writing it. That level of innovation and ownership keeps me energized every day.”\nOne initiative he’s especially proud of is Sprout’s Employee Purchase Program (EPP), which allows clients to offer retired assets back to employees at a discounted rate. “It’s been a win-win, promoting sustainability, extending device lifecycles, and building customer loyalty.”\nMichael’s team has also built Sprout’s B2C sales program from the ground up. They fully integrated all sales platforms into a unified system connected directly to Sprout’s Smart ERP, giving customers a seamless, data-driven experience. “People often assume sales is purely transactional,” he says. “But at Sprout, it’s about partnership, innovation, and giving customers transparency and results they can trust.”\nOutside of work, Michael’s energy doesn’t slow down. He’s traveled to 12 countries and 18 national parks, and he’s far from done. He’s also a big ice hockey fan and player (Go Washington Capitals!) and once played in a regional East Coast band with music videos and an EP.\nAs a leader, he’s inspired by seeing people grow into their potential. “I’ve been in their shoes before, so helping others succeed is deeply rewarding. Sprout offers endless growth opportunities, and watching that play out motivates me every day.”\nSince joining Sprout, Michael says he’s grown by learning to lean into opportunity and take initiative. “At Sprout, you truly help shape what the company becomes, and that sense of ownership has been a major driver of my personal and professional growth.”\nLooking ahead, he’s excited about Sprout’s expansion into multiple facilities and international markets. He sees huge potential in bringing Sprout’s eCommerce capabilities to new regions and continuing to innovate in how the company serves customers.\nIf he had to capture Sprout’s culture in one word, it would be _trust_. “It’s the foundation of everything we do, trust within our teams, and trust from our customers who rely on us to handle their sensitive assets responsibly.”\nMichael’s story is a reminder that Sprout’s greatest impact comes from the people who build, shape, and elevate it every day, one innovative idea at a time.\n# URL: https://www.sproutup.com/privacy-policy\n# Privacy Policy\nEffective date: 01/01/2020\n1.

Like companies, you can sometimes create more value breaking equipment into parts than bundling them together. The only difference is the trend line--stock values, overall, increase.\nIt's crucial to optimize between velocity and value. No one understand this concept, as clearly and intimately, as Sprout. By the end of 2020, we will have delivered $100M+ of equipment to the secondary device market. Let us manage the timing, the outlets, and the hundreds of other monetization nuances for you.\n# Device Monetization\n# Market Categories\n# Geographies\n# The Intersection of Product Protection & Sustainability\n# Even when your number one priority is to safeguard sub-optimal products from mis-appropriation in the secondary market, or protect next generation product lines, monetization of non-threatening parts can be good for your brand.\nBy reclaiming re-usable, non-IP components versus destroying, you can save a tremendous amount of raw material from being mined out of the earth.

The team has been very helpful and pleasant to work with. I strongly recommend Sprout.\"\n# Head of Service Partnerships\n# F50 Software Conglomerate\n# Overview\n# With an expansive physical footprint and best-in-class technology, Sprout does processing differently. It's not simply equipment receiving, scanning, & diagnostics to us. We triage equipment with your best interests in mind. And through our value-added processing, we maximize your overall return in a way that distinguishes us amongst our peers. This is why our processing enables you to:\n# Earmark equipment for donation to local communities, with Sprout taking on responsibilities of diagnostics, re-imaging, and warranty\n# Coordinate devices for screen, clean, refurbishment, reformatting, and return\n# Designate equipment types for asset-level registration and others for bulk recycling\n# Determine every detail of your custom solution, even if that's to destroy everything to smithereens\n# Equipment Triage\n# As each equipment pallet is unloaded at a Sprout-designated facility, we apply a unique barcode (if one had not already been appended at point of pickup), capture detailed receiving photos, and provide a bulk weight breakdown. There is no lag between these activities occurring within the facility and in the portal, so you can see the entire triage process, even from thousands of miles away.\nIf the equipment is comingled, Sprout operators will streamline the equipment into similar product categories. Once all the equipment has been triaged into conforming product categories, the pallets are moved into secure storage aisles, queued up to move through Sprout's processing lines.\n# System-Automated Processing\n# For product categories designated for asset-level tracking, the first step of Sprout's processing is to register the device by serial number, IMEI, asset tag, or other unique identifier. We also capture the device's make, model, and key attributes to provide you the most accurate records. Product categories designated for bulk processing are registered by weight and recycled without any monetization attempts.\nOnce a device is registered, the system can work its magic. Within Sprout's proprietary platform is a predictive analytics module called Load Builder. Load Builder scrapes our sales database and the web for the best related price to each newly registered asset. In seconds, it spits out a shortlist of potential monetization outlets and a benchmark of historical values. These outlets can range from selling a refurbished device on a specific B2C channel like Newegg to tearing down a particular device and selling high-demand parts to select extended warranty service providers with open POs at Sprout. Whatever the outcome, Load Builder instructs our technicians to process each asset in a manner that produces the optimal financial outcome.\nOf course, if you can set up a rule, you can also break it. In the event that you don't want your devices to be remarketed, as a whole or in parts, you can build custom instructions accordingly. Down to the particle size to which you'd like to see your equipment shredded, Sprout's platform gives you the power of choice.\n# URL: https://www.sproutup.com/solutions\n# Technology-Enabled Solutions\n# Select the solution that best satisfies your requirements and let Sprout create for you a program that runs on auto-pilot.\nCertified Destruction\nIT Asset Disposition\nLifecycle Optimization\nResponsible Recycling\n# URL: https://www.sproutup.com/sourcing-procurement\n#  Technology\nSourcing & Procurement\nOperations & Security\nSourcing & Procurement\nAsset Management\nCorporate Responsibility\n# Overview\n# As one of the world's largest asset recovery solutions providers, Sprout leverages machine learning to deliver services cost-effectively and, consequently, monetize equipment in a manner that maximizes your financial outcome.
