It’s our job to quickly assess whether to reuse or recycle the equipment. Recognizing that reusing electronics provides better environmental results and financial returns to our clients, we offer refurbishment, redeployment and resell services to optimize reuse potential.\nReuse of equipment eliminates the emissions associated with manufacturing new products, conserves natural resources by reducing the need for raw materials and avoids sending associated waste to landfills. This demonstrates both fiscal and environmental responsibility.\nUnderstanding that recycling is necessary in the ITAD process, SLS proactively is at the forefront of improving recycling technology. We invest in equipment that provides cleaner commodities that can more effectively be used to manufacture new products.\n## Purposeful Repurposing\nItems we process and refurbish that yield the highest returns in the secondary market include:\n  * Data center equipment\n  * Laptops and desktops\n  * Storage media\n  * Parts, including memory, processors and circuit boards\n  * Networking equipment\n## Additional Products We Accept at our Circular Centers\nWe are known for the depth and breadth of the services we offer. In addition to high demand items listed above, we also seek to extract value from all types of electronic equipment. The reuse and recycling of electronics decreases demand for resources required to produce new products and reduces landfill volumes. Computers and Peripherals\n  * Laptops\n  * Desktops\n  * Hard drives\n  * Network devices\n  * Circuit boards/cards\n  * Mobile devices (smart phones, tablets)\nData Center Equipment\n  * Servers\n  * Storage arrays\n  * Network related equipment\n  * Power distribution units (PDUs)\n  * Routers and switches\n  * Cabling\n  * Switchgear\n  * Panelboard\n  * Mainframe computer equipment\n  * Server racks\nStorage Media\n  * Magnetic hard drives\n  * Solid state hard drives\n  * Backup tapes\n  * Portable media including flash drives, CDs and DVDs\n  * Disk arrays\n  * Storage area network (SAN)\n  * Network attached storage (NAS)\nCertificates of Data Destruction available\nOther Electronics\n  * Electronics manufacturing scrap\n## Products Not Accepted\nWe do not accept equipment that contain liquids, gasses, or radioactive material or items that may be too large for us to accommodate in the SLS facilities.\n## An Industry Note\nSpecial handling is required for some components when recycling assets. As a responsible recycler, we manually remove these items from assets prior to recycling. They are packaged and sent to audited downstream vendors for final processing.\n## Certified ITAD Services\nSLS seeks certifications to demonstrate to clients that our Circular Centers adhere to local, regional and country regulations.\nView Certifications\n## Did You Know?\n### Sims Metal Offers Global Metal Recycling Services\nSims Metal is a sister company of Sims Lifecycle Services.

Portable media, such as USB thumb drives, CDs and DVDs, as well as copier, printer and scanner hard drives can contain data that, when overlooked and left intact, may compromise company, client and employee privacy.\n## Data Bearing Media\nSLS processes all media to ensure all your company’s sensitive data is properly destroyed. Backup Tapes\nSLS can catalog and destroy backup tape libraries and jukeboxes. Tapes can be degaussed or shredded, depending on client requirements.\nMagnetic Hard Drives\n**Desktop Computer Hard Drives – Laptop Hard Drives – Zip Disks – Floppy Disks**\nClients will typically elect to destroy any magnetic hard drives more than 4 years old. For newer hard drives, SLS offers on-site and off-site erasure, crushing, degaussing and shredding solutions.\nSolid State Drives\n**External Hard Drives – USB Thumb Drives – Laptop Solid-State Hard Drives (SSD)**\nThumb drives and external hard drives are common solid-state drives (SSD) used to store and transfer data. Solid-state drives are commonly used in desktop and laptop computers. These drives look similar to magnetic hard drives, but require specialized processing to ensure complete digital data destruction. If the data on SSDs are not properly destroyed, these drives can represent a potential security risk and introduce the threat of a data breach. For this reason, it is important to work with a service provider who has expertise and the specialized equipment to properly identify and destroy these devices.\nSLS offers proven data erasure and data destruction options for solid state hard drives. Data erasure allows for reuse of the drives, while shredding of solid state drives offers a proven solution when clients do not want solid state drives reused or resold.\nStorage Arrays and Storage Area Networks (SANs)\nWhether storage arrays and SANs are leased or owned, data on this equipment need to be destroyed. Like other data bearing devices, most companies are opting to destroy data on storage arrays and SANs while equipment is still within their custody.\n**Return to Lessor or Manufacturer** – Returning leased equipment to lessors with live data presents security risks during transport. SLS offers on-site data erasure where multiple drives can be erased at the same time. This service allows for efficient data wiping of SANs and allows companies to return leased equipment, data-free, eliminating any data security risks.\n**Prepare Equipment for Resale** – If SANs and storage arrays are owned instead of leased, data erasure at your facility prepares the equipment to be reused or sold, with no data security risks.\n**Destroy Storage Media to Ensure Data Security** – Destruction of storage media can be done at your location or at SLS processing facility. Storage media destruction, through shredding, crushing or degaussing, is the fastest data destruction method, but eliminates any resell potential from the retired equipment.\n## Site Audit\nThe technology supporting networked storage continues to change and varies with each manufacturer. SLS has broad experience and technical expertise in working with equipment from different manufacturers and companies who have a complex server environment.\nSLS can perform a site audit which would include an equipment survey to identify your storage media infrastructure. We can then develop a custom technical solution for effectively destroying data on all storage devices designated to be removed from your live environment.\nRequest a Review\nMobile Device Storage\n**Cell Phones – Smartphones – Tablets**\nThe convenience, size, and mobility of these devices make them a major threat to corporate data security protocols. The popularity, the availability and the data storage capacity of cell phones, smartphones and tablets increase potential data risks. Unlike servers and computers whose contents are subject to strict security policies, retired or broken mobile devices are often neglected, which leaves their valuable information at risk.\nSLS offers a completely secure and environmentally responsible solution for mitigating the security and environmental risks associated with the improper disposal of these devices. Shredding provides organizations with an additional measure of confidence that the information stored on these items is safely destroyed. Memory from mobile devices can be erased and reused or destroyed through shredding if reuse is not desired.\nHidden Digital Data on Office Equipment\n**Copiers – Printers – Scanners – All-In-One Devices**\nAdvanced office equipment, including printers, copiers, and scanners as well as mobile devices, such as cell phones, can be the source of unexpected digital data breaches. Very often these items are equipped with embedded hard drives and nonvolatile memory chips that retain data until that data is destroyed.\nEnsure all data bearing assets are identified and tracked. Most IT professionals are aware of the data security risks posed by these devices. However, if these assets are managed by facilities management or accounting department staff, they may be unaware of these risks when disposing of equipment.\n## View Video Highlighting On-Site Data Destruction Services\nOur mobile destruction equipment can wipe or physically destroy hardware so all data is destroyed and irrecoverable.\nView Video\n## On-Site Hard Drive Destruction – A Smart Idea\nA 30 minute conversation with a Data Destruction Advisor can help generate a cost effective proposal aligned to your specific data security requirements.\nGet a Quote\n# URL: https://www.simslifecycle.com/business/data-destruction/vendor-selection\n  On-Site Data Destruction\n  Bulk Data Destruction\n  Data Destruction Standards\n  Types of Storage Media\n  Vendor Selection\n## On-site Data Destruction Services\nFor those organizations with strict data security and regulatory compliance needs, locate a vendor that can provide on-site hard drive destruction services. As soon as data bearing equipment leaves a company’s premises, any intact data residing on that equipment becomes vulnerable to exposure and can subject that company to a potential data breach incident.\nOn-Site Hard Drive Shredding\n## Secure Chain of Custody\nIf on-site hard drive data destruction is not a possibility, secure transportation of data bearing assets is important. Choose a vendor that offers an unbroken chain of custody from pickup to transportation to destruction.

Recognize the data destruction process is only as good as the technicians performing it.\n  * _At SLS we are accustomed to handling all levels ofdata security requirements therefore you can be assured that we will help you choose the most suitable and secure method of data destruction which meets your business needs._\nDefined Processes & Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)\nThe importance of a standardized and documented process cannot be overstated. Questions about data breaches from retired IT assets seldom surface immediately. If a stray hard drive with data is discovered 5 years down the road, the key to minimizing liability will be your ability to demonstrate that your company took prudent precautions when the asset was retired and disposed.\n  * _SLS uses clearly defined processes, guided byindustry and government standards to make certain all digital data is destroyed and that no storage device is skipped during the process. Our audited processes provide peace of mind, accountability and assurance that your company’s privacy and corporate reputation remain intact when managing your end of life IT assets._\nSecure Processing Facilities\nObserve first-hand the physical security measures in place at a vendor facility where data will be destroyed and confirm that employees have been background checked and drug screened. A site visit of the facility can be an important step in verifying your assets and data will be securely managed.\n  * _SLS processing facilities are access controlled and monitored, ensuringmaximum protection of your data bearing assets prior to destruction. All assets are stored and secured until processing begins. Security measures implemented at all SRS facilities include physical barriers, intrusion alarm systems, CCTV surveillance, limited access and locked areas, strict visitor controls, secured storage, 24/7 security guards, metal detectors, strategic lighting, and alarmed peripheral exits. Background checks are done on all new employees and IT security protocols are in place to protect client assets._\nAudit Trail – Asset Tracking and Sims Portal\nBeing able to produce documented processes and proof that these processes were consistently followed will be important deciding factors should your operations be audited. Certificates of data destruction and consistent documented audit trails are important proof points. Regardless of the method of data destruction, request certificates of data destruction to demonstrate that all data is destroyed.\n_At SLS, all items received for data destruction are tracked via our online inventory module which is accessible to clients via theSims Portal. Clients are able to track, monitor and create reports on the status of data bearing assets. Certificates of Data Destruction can be provided, regardless of the destruction service provided – data erasure, on-site destruction, witnessed destruction or plant recycling._\nShield from Data Breach Liability – Cyber Security Insurance\nThere are specialized risks in managing the disposition of end of life electronics for businesses, including environmental and data security risks. Be sure your selected vendor offers protection for you in case your electronics are mishandled.\n  * _SLS offers our clients an added layer of protection by carrying specializedpollution liability and cyber security insurance. We maintain this insurance to demonstrate our commitment to protecting the interests of our clients and responsibly managing their retired assets._\nComplete Range of Processing Services\nChoose a vendor who manages services in-house. A company that is able to provide a complete range of processing services eliminates reliance on partners to process an organization’s retired electronics, which improves accountability and streamlines reporting.\n  * _SLS offers comprehensive capabilities in supporting a wide range ofelectronics recycling services and IT asset disposition. We offer data destruction services for a wide range of storage devices and provide these services at your location and also at our processing facilities._\n## Keep Your Data Safe & Secure\nEach day, your organization generates its share of data; data that drives your competitive advantage and keeps your company moving forward.\nBut that same data left on retired IT assets can trigger a data disaster.
