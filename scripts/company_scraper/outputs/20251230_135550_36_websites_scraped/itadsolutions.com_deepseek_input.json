The crawl covers multiple pages (Home, About, Contact, etc.).\n2. There is significant overlapping/duplicate information across these pages.\n3. You MUST consolidate all information into a SINGLE company profile.\n4. Do NOT output a list of companies. Extract exactly ONE company object.\n5.

It’s certainly a challenging time for many of us as we navigate hurdles that change day by day.\nMany of the clients and people we work with are currently sheltering in place, however, if you work in the bioscience, medical and research fields, we want to first say thank you, and that we will continue to support you so that you may focus on one shared core goal: to stop this disease.\nWe wanted to let you know the steps our company has taken to continually service and support our client and customer’s needs, while keeping employee safety at the top of our minds.\n**First and foremost, all client data and equipment housed in our facility is safe and protected by our NAID (National Association of Information Destruction) AAA Certified processes, including 24 hour surveillance and monitoring.**\n**Our company itself is still open and operating, with limited crews.**\nWith San Francisco, California, and Dallas governance decreeing shelter in place mandates, we have taken dramatic steps to encourage social distancing and limit onsite staff to only essential processors.\n  * In addition to minimizing the number of staff, we are rotating employees and splitting shifts to limit workforce contact.\n  * Staff has been trained to undergo enhanced cleaning procedures, including sanitation and isolation of incoming equipment.\n  * The rest of the staff has been assigned to work from home, or to simply shelter in place.\n  * Travel is being restricted, and in person meetings have been replaced with teleconferencing.\n  * We are actively working with our clients to engage in contact-less pickups, where interaction can be kept to a minimum.\n  * Non-essential pickups have been postponed.\n  * Community pickups and ewaste drop-offs have been temporarily stopped.\n  * Out-of-State and International Pickups, if not restricted, are still taking place with local governance allowance.\n  * We are also asking our downstream partners to practice the same strict precautions to prevent exposure, and limit social contact.\nThe end result of these actions will undoubtedly add time and delays to our normal processing windows. We apologize for this and ask for your understanding as we all endure this challenging time together.\nThank you and keep safe.\nJohn Bekiaris & The entire iTAD Solutions Team\n# ITAD SOLUTIONS IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN CREATING AND MANAGING ENTERPRISE LEVEL IT ASSET DISPOSITION PROGRAMS\nWe provide full ewaste and asset management from our headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as nationwide and international.\nWith over 120 partners worldwide, managed through the myITAD portal, we offer a seamless and integrated global solution for your end of life assets.\nWe provide a single point of contact, a standardized reporting tool, and a simplified, cost-effective global solution, tailored to your local needs.\nOur ITAD Network of Partners means your risks are minimized\nWhat is most important to you?
