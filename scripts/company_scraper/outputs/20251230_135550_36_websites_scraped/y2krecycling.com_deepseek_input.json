We do NOT export e-waste. We require assets to be \"Tested Functional\" (R2v3 F2/C3 or better)\n\n## YOUR TASK\nYou are analyzing a company website. The provided content belongs to ONE SINGLE company.\nAll URLs are under the same root domain.\nThe content contains text from multiple pages, separated by \"# URL: \".\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. The crawl covers multiple pages (Home, About, Contact, etc.).\n2. There is significant overlapping/duplicate information across these pages.\n3. You MUST consolidate all information into a SINGLE company profile.\n4. Do NOT output a list of companies. Extract exactly ONE company object.\n5. Ignore minor differences in descriptions across pages; synthesize them into a comprehensive summary.\n\n## INFORMATION TO EXTRACT\n\n1. **Company Information:**\n   - Company name\n   - Main website URL (the root domain, e.g., https://example.com)\n   - Main business/industry\n   - Brief description of what they do\n\n2. **Products/Services:**\n   - List all products or services offered\n   - Key capabilities or specializations\n\n3. **Contact Information:**\n   - ALL email addresses found (support, sales, info, contact, etc.)\n   - Phone numbers\n   - Physical address/location\n   - Contact page URLs\n\n4. **Additional Details:**\n   - Company size (if mentioned)\n   - Year founded (if mentioned)\n   - Certifications or awards (especially R2v3, e-Stewards)\n   - Geographic coverage/service areas\n\n## VENDOR QUALIFICATION CRITERIA\n\nEvaluate if this company is a good fit for Yilong based on these 2 pillars:\n\n### PILLAR 1: INVENTORY FIT\n**Must Have:**\n- Enterprise IT assets: Laptops, Desktops, Data Center Servers, Networking Equipment, Storage\n\n**Bonus Points:**\n- Harvested components (high-value CPU, RAM, SSD/HDD)\n\n**Condition Requirements:**\n- Grade A/B (Ready for Retail) - Preferred\n- Tested Functional Grade C (Ready for Refurbishment) - Acceptable\n\n**RED FLAGS:**\n- Only handles residential recycling (curbside pickup)\n- Focuses primarily on shredding/scrap metal\n- No mention of testing or grading\n- Only handles consumer electronics (phones, tablets, TVs)\n\n### PILLAR 2: OPERATIONAL FIT\n**Business Type:**\n- Must be an ITAD Processor or Asset Recovery Firm (B2B focus)\n- NOT a retail reseller or consumer-focused recycler\n\n**Certification:**\n- R2v3 certification is highly preferred (indicates they can test/wipe data correctly)\n- e-Stewards is also acceptable\n\n**Sales Channel:**\n- Must support Wholesale / Bulk sales (Pallet/Truckload quantities)\n- If they only sell single units on eBay/Amazon to consumers, they are a BAD fit\n\n**RED FLAGS:**\n- Only residential/consumer services\n- No B2B capabilities mentioned\n- No certifications\n- Only retail sales channels\n\n## EVALUATION OUTPUT\nBased on the above criteria, provide:\n- is_good_fit: true/false - Is this company worth reaching out to?\n- inventory_fit_assessment: Detailed explanation of how they match our inventory needs\n- operational_fit_assessment: Detailed explanation of their operational capabilities\n- red_flags: List of any concerns or disqualifying factors\n- recommendation: \"Reach out\", \"Skip\", or \"Research further\"\n- reasoning: Clear explanation of why you recommend reaching out or skipping\n\nBe thorough and extract ALL contact emails you can find.\nIf information is not available, use null for that field.\n",

For more information about recycling in California and mandated procedures, visit DTSC or CalRecycle websites.\nWhat should I do about the data on my hard drive?\nY2K does NOT recover or destroy data from any hard drive.
