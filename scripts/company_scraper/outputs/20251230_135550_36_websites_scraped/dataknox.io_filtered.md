### What are Cloud Managed Services?  

Cloud Managed Services provide skilled resources that support departments and business technology infrastructure through a convenient 3rd party platform.   

We handle the time-consuming administrative work involved in managing your technology so that you can focus on growing your business.  

[get started](https://www.dataknox.io/contact-us)
The Cloud Managed Services market is witnessing accelerated growth in recent years due to the advancements in cloud computing, big data, and mobility services. It is estimated to become a $120 billion market by the year 2020.  

Cloud Managed Services help lower in-house IT costs, optimize IT systems and automate IT processes, leaving more time for businesses to work towards their strategic goals. Enabling organizations to augment competences that they lack or to replace functions or processes that incur huge recurring costs, cloud managed services provide them the flexibility and freedom they need to pursue value-adding activities.  

## We Deliver
We are honored to support the most innovative and demanding organizations, from dynamic Startups to the Fortune 100.

### What is Migration?  

Cloud migration services refer to the way in which your business migrates to the cloud and the products you use to get there. Cloud providers themselves (such as Azure, AWS and Google) all offer tools and services to help migrate your workloads and applications.

This decision is not always easy, since on the surface the big three providers AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) seem to offer similar tools and pricing. But, do a little scratching beneath the surface and you’ll find that each has their own particular strengths.

Many businesses rely on server infrastructure for essential IT operations such as data storage, website hosting, emails, and applications. While there has been a shift towards utilizing servers in massive, remote data centers through cloud services, many organizations continue to maintain in-house servers or adopt a hybrid model that combines in-house and cloud solutions for server data management. Managing a server, whether on-site or in the cloud, involves meticulous attention to hardware, software, security, and backup procedures. 
In this guide, I delve into the optimal ways to manage servers, focusing on the current advancements in server technology, addressing security issues, and highlighting the significance of selecting the right server monitoring tools to enhance your management efforts.
## What Is Server Management?
Server management involves the consistent oversight and upkeep of servers to ensure their optimal functionality. This encompasses handling hardware, software, security measures, and backup systems. The key objectives of a robust server management approach are to:
  * Significantly reduce, if not entirely prevent, server lags and outages
  * Establish a secure foundation for server operations
  * Adapt servers to cater to the changing demands of a progressing organization.


## How Does Server Management Work? 
The fundamentals of server management encompass handling hardware, software, security, and backups, all of which can be effortlessly managed via the Dataknox Client Portal, utilizing its patent-pending technology. This portal allows for simplified viewing and management of your assets, maintenance scheduling, and colocation support. Any IT approach or software tool must address essential components for successful server management, including Hardware Management, Software Management, Security, Backups, and other related areas.
## What Includes Server Management?
### Hardware Management
The cornerstone of proficient server management is maintaining hardware in optimal working conditions. If hardware becomes unreliable, it can hinder business productivity. Therefore, it's vital to consistently oversee at least five main elements that contribute to server hardware's overall performance and reliability.
### Software Management 
Similarly to hardware, vigilant monitoring and routine maintenance are crucial for server software. Grasping the interdependencies of software within your infrastructure aids in identifying and fine-tuning performance bottlenecks. Adhering to foundational best practices in application oversight ensures that your existing software, firmware, and operating systems receive timely updates, optimizing performance and security. 
Lackluster performance can strain other system components and may expose weak points for cyberattacks. Removing outdated software that is no longer in use is also advisable.
### Security
A pivotal aspect of server management is ensuring robust network security. The security protocols adopted often vary based on the business's specific requirements and industry nature. Typical server security measures encompass:
  * Deploying and regularly updating antivirus software
  * Establishing firewalls to deter unauthorized access
  * Implementing password protocols or access control tools to mandate strong passwords and frequent updates
  * Encrypting critical data storage and external network communications
  * Reviewing and adhering to security logging standards to discern possible threat patterns.


### Backups 
A crucial aspect of proficient server management is consistent data backup. Losing valuable data can wreak havoc on any organization. Thankfully, the market offers myriad backup solutions, including software tailored for physical and virtual server backups.
It's equally essential to have a backup for the server's power supply to prevent data loss during power interruptions. Several tools enable swift backup and recovery actions, automate these processes, and facilitate easy monitoring of backup statuses, minimizing data loss risks.
While numerous tools excel in managing backups for individual devices or networks, not all are adept at large-scale operations. If overseeing backups across diverse networks and for various clients is necessary, you'll require a specialized solution to guarantee client data protection and optimize time efficiency.
## Management of Different Server Types
We cater to a variety of server types. Whether you're a small enterprise with a tower server and a network-attached storage device, a mid-sized business boasting multiple rack-mounted servers, or even blade servers, we've got you covered. Our expertise spans a broad spectrum of brands, from Dell, HP, HPe, Lenovo, IBM, Gigabyte, Asus, and Cisco, to Supermicro. To ensure the optimal functioning of your existing data center, we provide a selection of warranty options. Our support extends to all storage devices, network equipment, laptops, desktops, and any other equipment interconnected with your IT network.
## Server Hardware Components
### Central Processing Unit (CPU)
Often referred to as the server's brain, the CPU executes all computations necessary for program functioning. Constant monitoring of CPU usage is vital to prevent over-taxation. An overworked CPU, operating near 100% for prolonged periods, leaves no room for additional tasks, potentially slowing the entire server. You might need to upgrade the chip, add more CPUs, or stop non-essential programs to combat this. Complex solutions include tuning other system parts to reduce CPU stress.
### Random Access Memory (RAM)
RAM, or the server's working memory, provides quicker access than permanent hard disks, allowing programs to run more efficiently. More RAM equates to improved performance, so monitoring usage and adding more when approaching full capacity is wise.
### Hard Drive
This permanent storage, also known as a hard disk, retains programs and data even after shutdown. As it nears full capacity, performance may decline. Monitoring space, adding drives, or removing redundant data (or opting for cloud storage) is essential. See my guide on checking hard drive health for signs of failure.
### Network/Port
Network ports facilitate communication, connecting servers at host-determined speeds. It's crucial to ensure adequate network adapters and connections for the server.
### Operating Environment
Alongside the server's internal temperature, attention must be paid to the surrounding environment. Proper temperature, humidity, and airflow in the server room are key to optimal performance and reliability.
## Server Management Components
### Server Monitoring 
This involves the systematic observation and evaluation of metrics to gauge server performance. By monitoring servers, businesses can ensure optimal operation at all times and proactively detect and address potential issues, mitigating real-time performance impacts. Importantly, this oversight provides insights into your IT framework, empowering you to make informed choices regarding future growth.
### Server Maintenance 
Proper server maintenance is essential to prevent unexpected performance problems within your business. This involves updating the server itself, its software, and security features, all aimed at timely preventive actions. Regular system audits are a key component of server maintenance, assessing the effectiveness of security measures. By allowing for necessary updates, migration, backup, and restoration procedures, you can ensure that your server's performance remains robust and risk-free.
### Tailored Server Configuration
Server management isn't a universal formula; the needs vary depending on usage. For example, a WordPress blog server would have a different setup than one hosting e-commerce site. Your server's setup should be impactful and align with your business objectives. That's where proficient server management steps in. It's pivotal for your IT team to evaluate your hosting needs to define the most apt server configuration and specifications for your enterprise. When initializing a server, adhering to industry-established norms is prudent. By employing these, you can shape your server for peak performance and fortified defense against cyber threats.
### Server Stability
Factors such as speed, load, service uptime, and server software play a crucial role in maintaining server stability. Even minor changes in configuration, errors, or conflicts can disrupt the entire server, leading to suboptimal performance. Professionals in server management diligently oversee timely updates to avoid these conflicts. Key aspects of server performance, like page load time or database lag, should be periodically assessed and fine-tuned to sustain optimal performance.
### Uptime Guarantee 
The lifeblood of any online business is consistent uptime. An unreliable server fails to ensure uptime and can erode your profits. When a website lags in loading, users typically navigate away. Proper server management practices ensure that your servers deliver commendable uptime. As highlighted earlier, achieving this hinges on continuous server monitoring.
## The Importance of Server Management
Server management might appear intricate, yet it's pivotal for the seamless operation of your network. Grasping the fundamentals of server management and deploying the right tools can fortify your business's security.
Every organization utilizing servers, whether physical or virtual, requires server management. This need can be direct or indirect and varies based on the server type. Customers on shared hosting or managed virtual server hosting plans are exceptions; in such cases, the hosting company or external service providers oversee server management. In the case of virtual private servers, the need is more nuanced. While hardware falls under the purview of third-party providers, software management might rest partly or wholly with the customer. This distinction marks the difference between managed and unmanaged VPS. 
From small enterprises with a mere online display to expansive social media platforms needing server clusters for scalability or entities leveraging a VMware hosting plan solely for running virtual machines – all stand to gain from effective server management.
## Requirements for Effective Server Management
When an organization prepares to establish its initial server or network, the primary step involves setting up the server(s) under consideration. This may encompass assembling certain server components and installing the operating system that governs the server.
Following the setup, both hardware and software require configuration. Most of this work takes place within the operating system, recognizing available components and getting ready to mesh with the software that will enhance its functionality. The configuration ensures the server is tailored to suit the organization's needs and is primed for efficient operation.
## Internal vs. External Server Monitoring
Depending on specific requirements, an organization's Server management can be approached internally or externally. Suppose the company utilizes dedicated on-premises servers. In that case, an in-house technician or IT department may be responsible for the initial setup, monitoring, and ongoing management, or the company may outsource to a [third-party provider](https://www.dataknox.io/third-party-maintenance) to monitor server function and performance.
In scenarios where servers are cloud-based or part of a hybrid system, the management may also be hybrid or entirely handled by an external IT specialist or team. Understanding the distinctions between cloud servers and physical servers can guide your decision-making process in choosing the best server management strategy for your needs.
Alternatively, external monitoring might encompass software that oversees server activity and uptime remotely yet is managed by an internal team. Even if the servers are off-site, an in-house technician can supervise them.
The decision between external and in-house monitoring strategies might vary, especially when considering managed vs unmanaged dedicated servers. It is about aligning the right strategy with your organization's unique demands and infrastructure.
## Advantages of Outsourcing Server Management
Outsourcing server management involves overseeing hardware, software, security, and backups, centralizing the administration of these key components. The main objectives of a successful server management approach, whether handled in-house or outsourced, include:
  * Reducing, and ideally eradicating, server slowdowns and interruptions
  * Creating secure server surroundings
  * Making certain that servers persistently adapt to an organization's evolving needs and demands

## What is Third Party Maintenance?
When your IT equipment reaches the end of its warranty, you may be wondering what your options are for maintaining it. You could continue to pay high OEM maintenance fees, but this can add up over time. Alternatively, you could switch to a third-party maintenance provider, such as Dataknox.  
  
Third-party maintenance offers a number of advantages over OEM support. First, it is often much more affordable. Dataknox can save you up to 50% on your IT maintenance costs. Second, third-party providers are more flexible and can customize a maintenance plan to meet your specific needs. For example, you may want to choose a plan that includes proactive maintenance services, such as preventive cleaning and tune-ups.  

## How Does Third-Party Maintenance Help You?

## Third-party maintenance for end-of-life (EOL) IT equipment
When your IT equipment reaches EOL, it can be tempting to simply replace it with new equipment. However, this can be a costly and time-consuming process. A more affordable and efficient option is to consider third-party maintenance for EOL equipment.
󰗡
**Hardware repair:** Third-party technicians can repair your EOL equipment, even if the OEM no longer offers support.
󰗡
**Software updates:** Third-party providers can often provide software updates for EOL operating systems and applications.
󰗡
**Security patches:** Third-party providers can provide security patches for EOL software and firmware.

## Stop Paying the Cloud Ransom
Dataknox delivers the ultimate cyber-resilient cloud backup solution by leveraging Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage to guarantee zero egress fees, lightning-fast restores, and total immunity from ransomware.
[Free Cost Analysis 󰁔](https://www.dataknox.io/wasabi-cloud-backup-zero-egress#get-started)
![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61486d79523e4f34418faac3/690a4163e8f01afd9cd87e92_wasabi.jpg)
## Finally, Cloud Backup That Doesn't Hold You Hostage
We partner with **Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage** to destroy the two biggest threats to your data and budget.  

### The Ransomware Threat
Your backup is your ultimate air gap
Cybercriminals don't just attack your primary systems. They target your backups too. If they encrypt your primary data _and_ delete your secondary backups, they win. Period.  
  
‍**The Dataknox Fix** We automatically enable **Wasabi Object Lock** on your backups. This isn't just encryption. It's **WORM storage** (Write Once, Read Many). Once a file hits the cloud, it's literally impossible for anyone—an attacker, a hacker, or even an accidental admin—to delete or alter it for a period you define. **Your backup is your ultimate air gap.**
### The Cloud Cost Threat
Why pay a penalty to save your business?
Hyperscalers charge you to store data, and then they penalize you when you try to get it back (that's egress). You're charged every time you test, restore, or recover from a disaster.   
  
**The Dataknox Fix** Because we use Wasabi's revolutionary platform, there are **ZERO EGRESS FEES** and **ZERO API CHARGES**. Your cost is simple, predictable, and based only on the data you store. **Restore 300 times a year? Your bill doesn't budge.**
##  **Get Your IT Team Out of the Backup Business**  

Your internal team wasn't hired to spend hours configuring Object Lock policies or troubleshooting slow restore jobs. Dataknox handles the complexity so your experts can focus on revenue.
#### What Dataknox Delivers
#### The Benefit to You
#### Seamless Integration
We ensure flawless compatibility and performance with all major platforms **(Veeam, Commvault, Rubrik, etc.)**.
#### Proactive Management
We manage the Wasabi infrastructure, monitor your backups, and verify policy compliance—**you get a hands-off, guaranteed solution.**
#### Single, Fast Storage Tier
Wasabi is **Hot Cloud Storage** —it's high-speed access without the "cold storage" wait. We eliminate the complex tier management and slow recovery times of other providers.
#### Enterprise-Grade Security
We enforce **MFA, SSO,** and utilize Wasabi’s unique **Multi-User Authentication** requiring sign-off from multiple users to prevent account takeover disaster.
##  **See the Savings. Feel the Speed.**  

#### Comparison Point
#### Dataknox + Wasabi
#### Traditional Hyperscaler Cloud
#### Retrieval Fees (Egress)
$0.00
High variable fees
#### Ransomware Defense
Built-in, Immutability (WORM)
Requires complex, add-on security services
#### Billing Model
Simple, predictable, flat rate
Complex, unpredictable with charges for retrieval and requests
