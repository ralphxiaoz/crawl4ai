## ITAD Equipment We Process and Remarket
The most common shipments we receive from businesses include both electronics that have reuse potential and equipment that is old and has no useful life. It’s our job to quickly assess whether to reuse or recycle the equipment. Recognizing that reusing electronics provides better environmental results and financial returns to our clients, we offer refurbishment, redeployment and resell services to optimize reuse potential.
Reuse of equipment eliminates the emissions associated with manufacturing new products, conserves natural resources by reducing the need for raw materials and avoids sending associated waste to landfills. This demonstrates both fiscal and environmental responsibility.
Understanding that recycling is necessary in the ITAD process, SLS proactively is at the forefront of improving recycling technology. We invest in equipment that provides cleaner commodities that can more effectively be used to manufacture new products. 
![laptops stacked ready for refurbishment](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/SLS-Product-3417-1024x563.png)

## On-Premise Data Center Decommissioning
Companies are permanently closing corporate data centers as more workload transitions to the cloud. SLS can return these data centers to a clean sweep empty space, removing and shipping all equipment to one of our processing facilities. There the equipment is evaluated and either prepared for redeployment, resell through e-commerce channels or sold to specialized buyers. Any obsolete equipment is responsibly recycled.
![](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/Data-Center-Services-Chart-web.png)
## Benefits of Using SLS
Complete decommissioning, data destruction, asset resale and recycling, all from a single vendor. We handle it all, giving you:
  * The convenience of working with a single vendor
  * Confidence that data is destroyed and inventory is accurately counted
  * Advanced refurbishment capabilities which helps increase asset and component reuse, and decrease the need for recycling
  * Access to our expert remarketing team and their proven resell program
  * Top dollar in resale in the secondary market
  * Assurance that your obsolete equipment is [recycled responsibly](https://www.simslifecycle.com/business/e-waste-recycling/)
  * A [sustainability](https://www.simslifecycle.com/global/circular-economy/) success story – the reuse and recycling of electronics decreases demand for resources used to produce new products and reduces landfill volumes


## Additional Services
### Co-Located Data Center Services
We routinely work in colocated data centers, on behalf of our clients, to remove equipment from their designated cage area. We are registered at many data centers and our technicians have been approved to go on-site by data center managers. We deinstall servers and blades and can destroy data prior to equipment being shipped to one of our processing centers.

## Services at SLS Facility
![](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/06/shredder-knives.jpg)
####  Bulk Hard Drive Shredding 
Any data-bearing media that our clients do not want to reuse or resell is physically destroyed. Sims uses state-of-the-art, high-capacity hard drive shredders to destroy all data-bearing media. The entire hard drive, including platters is shredded into small pieces making it impossible to reconstruct the media or data.
![hard drive erasure](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/Processing-3696-720x396.png)
####  Bulk Data Erasure 
SLS uses commercial and proprietary software to erase hard drives. Erasure allows hard drives to securely be reused. Our processes are compliant with NIST 80-888 r1, ISO/IED 21964 (formerly DIN-66399) and HMG IA Standard No. 5. Bulk erasure at our facilities is controlled via formalized standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure all hard drives are 100% overwritten, and that no hard drive is skipped in the process.
![](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/10/aerial-view-sweden.jpg)
####  Witnessed Destruction 
Some situations require that clients physically witness the destruction of the electronic media. SLS can accommodate this witnessed destruction of hard drives and storage media by hosting the client at our processing facility. Alternatively, witnessing can be facilitated by providing a webcam link to witness the destruction remotely. We also can provide video recording of client hard drives being destroyed. 
![](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/data-destruction-2.png)
## Data Destruction Guaranteed
SLS uses clearly defined processes, guided by industry and government standards to make certain all digital data is destroyed. Our audited processes provide peace of mind, accountability and assurance that your company’s privacy and corporate reputation remain intact. 
Certificates of Data Destruction can be provided, regardless of the service provided – data erasure, hard drive shredding or witnessed destruction.
## Bulk Data Destruction Services
SLS guarantees complete digital data destruction services and provides Certificates of Data Destruction and Certificates of Recycling as required.

## Data Protection Regulation
SLS follows procedures that are in compliance with regulatory standards for personal data protection. We offer services to completely destroy data across a wide variety of devices including magnetic and solid state drives.
### NIST 800-88-r1, Guidelines for Media Sanitation
National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-88 r1 Guidelines (NIST 800-88r1), published in December 2014, is the most commonly cited guidelines used in the United States. NIST provides guidelines for data destruction for:
  * Hard copy (paper) storage sanitization
  * Networking device sanitization
  * Mobile device sanitization
  * Equipment sanitization
  * Magnetic media sanitization
  * Peripherally attached storage sanitization
  * Optical media sanitization
  * Flash memory based storage device sanitization
  * RAM and ROM based storage device sanitization
  * Cryptographic erase considerations


SLS follows procedures that are in strict compliance with NIST 800-88 r1, in the US.
[View NIST 800-88-r1 standard here](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf)
##  HMG IA Standard No. 5 
In the U.K. the Cabinet Office’s HMG’s Security Policy Framework (SPF) mandates that sensitive data must be destroyed in line with HMG Information Assurance Standard No 5 – Secure Sanitisation of Protectively Marked or Sensitive Information. Most companies require adherence to this standard. There is a specific mandate within this standard related to data destruction, listing 6 Business Impact Levels (BILs). SLS delivers guaranteed residual data destruction services which meet all BILs.
##  ISO/IEC 21964 (formerly DIN-66399) 
SLS Germany uses shredding technology that complies with the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz), as well as the new DIN-66399 regulations up to security levels H4 / H5.
## On-Site Hard Drive Destruction – A Smart Idea
A 30 minute conversation with a Data Destruction Advisor can help generate a cost effective proposal aligned to your specific data security requirements.

## At your office. Because sometimes, sensitive data simply cannot leave your business.
### Lockable Storage Bins
SLS offers lockable storage bins to secure accumulated hard drives until destruction services are provided. These tamper-proof bins hold hard drives, CDs, DVDs, thumb drives, mobile phones & other data bearing storage devices until collections are sufficient to warrant a SLS technician coming on-site. These secure bins can also be used to transport storage devices to a SLS facility for final processing.
## Data Erasure
**FOR: Magnetic hard drives and solid state drives**
Erasing instead of destroying the hard drive enables clients to redeploy hard drives internally or resell erased hard drives. A great solution for destroying data, ensuring value recovery and extending the useful life of your IT equipment.
## Degaussing
**FOR: Loose magnetic hard drives and backup tapes**
Data is destroyed through the use of powerful electromagnetic fields. The magnetic charge renders data unrecoverable. Degaussing is quick and easy.
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Effective only for magnetic drives and tapes. Degaussing does not destroy data on solid state hard drives.
## Hard Drive Crushing
**FOR: Small projects (less than 500 drives)**
Our hard drive crushers provide a quick and convenient way to destroy small volumes of hard drives.
## Case Study On-Site Data Destruction
SLS’ shredder vehicle and security-cleared staff visited nine sites and provided witnessed destruction of over 5,500 units of media.
“On this particular project the time constraints were limited but SLS were extremely helpful in ensuring the project was delivered on time to the customers’ specifications. The project was managed professionally and efficiently with SLS updating us at every step of the project.”

![](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/05/Data-Destruction-2-1024x563.png)
Digital data exists on many devices today, not just computers and servers. Portable media, such as USB thumb drives, CDs and DVDs, as well as copier, printer and scanner hard drives can contain data that, when overlooked and left intact, may compromise company, client and employee privacy.
## Data Bearing Media
SLS processes all media to ensure all your company’s sensitive data is properly destroyed. Backup Tapes 
    
SLS can catalog and destroy backup tape libraries and jukeboxes. Tapes can be degaussed or shredded, depending on client requirements. 

Magnetic Hard Drives 
    
**Desktop Computer Hard Drives – Laptop Hard Drives – Zip Disks – Floppy Disks**
Clients will typically elect to destroy any magnetic hard drives more than 4 years old. For newer hard drives, SLS offers on-site and off-site erasure, crushing, degaussing and shredding solutions. 

Solid State Drives 
    
**External Hard Drives – USB Thumb Drives – Laptop Solid-State Hard Drives (SSD)**
Thumb drives and external hard drives are common solid-state drives (SSD) used to store and transfer data. Solid-state drives are commonly used in desktop and laptop computers. These drives look similar to magnetic hard drives, but require specialized processing to ensure complete digital data destruction. If the data on SSDs are not properly destroyed, these drives can represent a potential security risk and introduce the threat of a data breach. For this reason, it is important to work with a service provider who has expertise and the specialized equipment to properly identify and destroy these devices.
SLS offers proven data erasure and data destruction options for solid state hard drives. Data erasure allows for reuse of the drives, while shredding of solid state drives offers a proven solution when clients do not want solid state drives reused or resold. 

Storage Arrays and Storage Area Networks (SANs) 
    
Whether storage arrays and SANs are leased or owned, data on this equipment need to be destroyed. Like other data bearing devices, most companies are opting to destroy data on storage arrays and SANs while equipment is still within their custody.
**Return to Lessor or Manufacturer** – Returning leased equipment to lessors with live data presents security risks during transport. SLS offers on-site data erasure where multiple drives can be erased at the same time. This service allows for efficient data wiping of SANs and allows companies to return leased equipment, data-free, eliminating any data security risks.
**Prepare Equipment for Resale** – If SANs and storage arrays are owned instead of leased, data erasure at your facility prepares the equipment to be reused or sold, with no data security risks.
**Destroy Storage Media to Ensure Data Security** – Destruction of storage media can be done at your location or at SLS processing facility. Storage media destruction, through shredding, crushing or degaussing, is the fastest data destruction method, but eliminates any resell potential from the retired equipment. 
## Site Audit
The technology supporting networked storage continues to change and varies with each manufacturer. SLS has broad experience and technical expertise in working with equipment from different manufacturers and companies who have a complex server environment.
SLS can perform a site audit which would include an equipment survey to identify your storage media infrastructure. We can then develop a custom technical solution for effectively destroying data on all storage devices designated to be removed from your live environment.
Request a Review 

Mobile Device Storage 
    
**Cell Phones – Smartphones – Tablets**
The convenience, size, and mobility of these devices make them a major threat to corporate data security protocols. The popularity, the availability and the data storage capacity of cell phones, smartphones and tablets increase potential data risks. Unlike servers and computers whose contents are subject to strict security policies, retired or broken mobile devices are often neglected, which leaves their valuable information at risk.
SLS offers a completely secure and environmentally responsible solution for mitigating the security and environmental risks associated with the improper disposal of these devices. Shredding provides organizations with an additional measure of confidence that the information stored on these items is safely destroyed. Memory from mobile devices can be erased and reused or destroyed through shredding if reuse is not desired. 

Hidden Digital Data on Office Equipment 
    
**Copiers – Printers – Scanners – All-In-One Devices**
Advanced office equipment, including printers, copiers, and scanners as well as mobile devices, such as cell phones, can be the source of unexpected digital data breaches. Very often these items are equipped with embedded hard drives and nonvolatile memory chips that retain data until that data is destroyed.
Ensure all data bearing assets are identified and tracked. Most IT professionals are aware of the data security risks posed by these devices. However, if these assets are managed by facilities management or accounting department staff, they may be unaware of these risks when disposing of equipment.

![](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/09/Shred-Truck.jpg)
## On-site Data Destruction Services
For those organizations with strict data security and regulatory compliance needs, locate a vendor that can provide on-site hard drive destruction services. As soon as data bearing equipment leaves a company’s premises, any intact data residing on that equipment becomes vulnerable to exposure and can subject that company to a potential data breach incident.
[On-Site Hard Drive Shredding](https://www.simslifecycle.com/business/data-destruction/on-site-data-destruction/)
![](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/data-destruction-3.png)
## Secure Chain of Custody
If on-site hard drive data destruction is not a possibility, secure transportation of data bearing assets is important. Choose a vendor that offers an unbroken chain of custody from pickup to transportation to destruction. Establish from the beginning who will have access to equipment and how it will be handled from the time it is picked up until it is processed. 

Data Destruction Options 
    
Most companies have a mix of data bearing devices. Select a data destruction vendor who offers a range of services to accommodate: 
  * Small and large volumes of data bearing devices
  * Loose and in-machine hard drives
  * Backup tapes
  * Secure hard drive destruction – including hard drive destruction services for magnetic and solid state hard drives
  * Solid state drives and media
  * Storage area networks (SANs) and storage arrays
  * Optical storage devices (CDs and DVDs)
  * _SLS offers a range of[data destruction services](https://www.simslifecycle.com/business/data-destruction/) to facilitate reuse, resell or destruction of hard drives. Our hard drive destruction services and equipment enable us to support small and large data destruction projects at our clients’ location or at one of our processing facilities._



Expertise and Guidance 
    
In addition to the actual data destruction methods, it is also important that a vendor can provide expert guidance on how to destroy digital data. A well-informed vendor will ensure data is destroyed in the most cost-effective manner while meeting your data security requirements. 
  * _We encourage you to talk to one of our Data Destruction Advisors to discuss your current situation, your data privacy policies, the type and volume of storage device, whether they are loose or in-machine and whether you choose to reuse or recycle the equipment. SLS can develop a secure and cost-effective solution, tailored to your specific situation._



Trained Technicians and Calibrated Equipment 
    
Check that your selected vendor has documented policies that cover employee training on the use and calibration of data destruction equipment and software. Recognize the data destruction process is only as good as the technicians performing it. 
  * _At SLS we are accustomed to handling all levels of[data security requirements](https://www.simslifecycle.com/business/data-destruction/data-destruction-standards/) therefore you can be assured that we will help you choose the most suitable and secure method of data destruction which meets your business needs._



Defined Processes & Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) 
    
The importance of a standardized and documented process cannot be overstated. Questions about data breaches from retired IT assets seldom surface immediately. If a stray hard drive with data is discovered 5 years down the road, the key to minimizing liability will be your ability to demonstrate that your company took prudent precautions when the asset was retired and disposed. 
  * _SLS uses clearly defined processes, guided by[industry and government standards](https://www.simslifecycle.com/about-us/certifications/) to make certain all digital data is destroyed and that no storage device is skipped during the process. Our audited processes provide peace of mind, accountability and assurance that your company’s privacy and corporate reputation remain intact when managing your end of life IT assets._



Secure Processing Facilities 
    
Observe first-hand the physical security measures in place at a vendor facility where data will be destroyed and confirm that employees have been background checked and drug screened. A site visit of the facility can be an important step in verifying your assets and data will be securely managed. 
  * _SLS processing facilities are access controlled and monitored, ensuring[maximum protection of your data bearing assets](https://www.simslifecycle.com/business/data-destruction/at-srs-facility/) prior to destruction. All assets are stored and secured until processing begins. Security measures implemented at all SRS facilities include physical barriers, intrusion alarm systems, CCTV surveillance, limited access and locked areas, strict visitor controls, secured storage, 24/7 security guards, metal detectors, strategic lighting, and alarmed peripheral exits. Background checks are done on all new employees and IT security protocols are in place to protect client assets._



Audit Trail – Asset Tracking and Sims Portal 
    
Being able to produce documented processes and proof that these processes were consistently followed will be important deciding factors should your operations be audited. Certificates of data destruction and consistent documented audit trails are important proof points. Regardless of the method of data destruction, request certificates of data destruction to demonstrate that all data is destroyed. 
_At SLS, all items received for data destruction are tracked via our online inventory module which is accessible to clients via the[Sims Portal](https://www.simslifecycle.com/business/the-sims-portal/). Clients are able to track, monitor and create reports on the status of data bearing assets. Certificates of Data Destruction can be provided, regardless of the destruction service provided – data erasure, on-site destruction, witnessed destruction or plant recycling._ 

Shield from Data Breach Liability – Cyber Security Insurance 
    
There are specialized risks in managing the disposition of end of life electronics for businesses, including environmental and data security risks. Be sure your selected vendor offers protection for you in case your electronics are mishandled. 
  * _SLS offers our clients an added layer of protection by carrying specialized[pollution liability and cyber security insurance](https://www.simslifecycle.com/global/compliance/). We maintain this insurance to demonstrate our commitment to protecting the interests of our clients and responsibly managing their retired assets._



Complete Range of Processing Services 
    
Choose a vendor who manages services in-house. A company that is able to provide a complete range of processing services eliminates reliance on partners to process an organization’s retired electronics, which improves accountability and streamlines reporting. 
  * _SLS offers comprehensive capabilities in supporting a wide range of[electronics recycling](https://www.simslifecycle.com/business/e-waste-recycling/) services and [IT asset disposition](https://www.simslifecycle.com/business/itad/). We offer [data destruction services](https://www.simslifecycle.com/business/data-destruction/) for a wide range of storage devices and provide these services [at your location](https://www.simslifecycle.com/business/data-destruction/on-site-data-destruction/) and also [at our processing facilities](https://www.simslifecycle.com/business/data-destruction/at-sls-facility/)._


## Keep Your Data Safe & Secure
Each day, your organization generates its share of data; data that drives your competitive advantage and keeps your company moving forward.
But that same data left on retired IT assets can trigger a data disaster. At SLS, we understand the critical need to make sure all data is secure, even data on assets you no longer use. Our services ensure data on your retired assets stays safe and include: 
  * on-site hard drive degaussing and destruction
  * secure recycling facilities operated by screened employees
  * certified and documented processes


This safeguards the data stored on your retired IT assets and prevents your company from becoming a statistic.

NEW! - HOW TO GUIDE: Template for Developing IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) RFP
Close
[ Get Your Copy ](https://www.simslifecycle.com/business/itad/rfp-template-for-itad/)
We work closely with our clients to determine the right IT asset recovery strategy that is most closely aligned to your business objectives. How we recover value from your equipment is part of most conversations.
## IT Asset Recovery Options
  * Refurbish and resell through wholesale and retail channels
  * Refurbish and redeploy within your business
  * Dismantle and recovery parts and components for reuse
  * Equipment that no longer has useful life is responsibly recycled


## Refurbishment
Our refurbishment and repair services address cosmetic defects, broken or missing components and testing the unit for functionality prior to redeployment. Memory or hard drive upgrades can provide cost effective performance boosts and help further extend the asset lifecycle.
## Redeployment
Money spent on IT equipment continues to increase for most companies. Redeployment of used assets within your company can decrease the total cost of ownership by extending the overall asset lifecycle. Redeployment programs demonstrate fiscal and environmental responsibility.  
SLS redeploys equipment within the same company location or can facilitate delivery of equipment to different company locations or to remote employees.
## Resell IT Assets
Remarketing used equipment maximizes return on investment (ROI) and minimizes environmental impact. When assessing the resale potential of an IT asset, we consider the age, functionality, appearance and overall condition of the asset.
## How We Are Different
![](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/10/reports.jpg)
### Smart Pricing Analytics
Our proprietary pricing tool monitors key online marketplaces, to track sale value of completed transactions. We leverage this information for benchmarking and to forecast price variations and trends. Using data to model pricing in a fast-changing marketplace enables us to optimize our selling price in secondary markets.
![laptops stacked ready for refurbishment](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/SLS-Product-3417.png)
### Microsoft Authorized Reseller (MAR)
SLS is a Microsoft Authorized Refurbisher (MAR). Our MAR status certifies we install a genuine Windows operating system on all of our laptops and PCs. Having an up-to-date operating system on laptops and PCs increases the selling price of assets.

  * Higher resale value can be achieved when no transport damage occurs.
  * Increases chance that little to no damage will occur during handling and transit.
  * Aesthetics make a big impact on selling an asset.
  * It is easy to damage an item that has remained cosmetically perfect for months or years, just by moving it the wrong way.
  * Something that looks secure when sitting on a pallet can shift when bouncing down the road on a truck.


## You’ll Save Time and Money with These Packing Tips
We encourage clients to review these guidelines for shipping laptops, servers, monitors, hard drives, printers and computer accessories. Guidelines include packing materials needed and tips for how different equipment requires different packing.
**Please note** : These instructions do not describe security measures for any data bearing equipment. It is assumed that data has been destroyed on servers, laptops and hard drives prior to packing or that assets will be shipped using a secure shipping method. SLS provides [on-site data destruction services](https://www.simslifecycle.com/business/data-destruction/on-site-data-destruction/) for businesses if needed.

##  ![](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/The-Link-Portal.png)The Link Portal 
The Link Portal provides a secure and user friendly platform for managing ITAD and recycling services, tracking IT assets and generating reports. The Link Portal provides a holistic view of equipment, from the time an order is placed to final disposition. Work orders are centrally managed and asset reuse and recycling reports are conveniently available.
A roles based access control system enables authorized users to securely log in from anywhere.
### Data Integration for Client Assets
SLS is able to support API integration to client systems to seamlessly share information about asset disposition.
### Multi-Site Support
SLS recognizes the importance of managing information from your multiple office locations and providing a holistic view of assets. Reports can be generated based on shipping location. During onboarding, we can pre-populate the portal with information about each of your locations and point of contact for quick setup.
![](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/10/reports.jpg)
##  Report by Item – Asset Reporting 
Clients want item by item reporting for data bearing assets and assets that are resold or redeployed. We provide several standard reports that provide chain of custody proof points that confirm assets receipt, count and condition. Reports include make, model, serial number, asset tag, date received, weight and how and when the asset was reused or recycled. SLS supports multiple currencies and additional data capture for clients with unique requirements.
### Dashboard View
Besides our standard reports, the Link Portal supports customized lookups and reports. Search by category, client reference number, model, order number or received data. View asset specific information including category, description and diagnostic results.
![electronics recycling](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/ewaste-3.png)
##  Electronic Recycling – Weight Reports 
If the unit of measure for client reports is by weight, pre-processing will include weighing shipments as they are received and accounting for commodity recovery after recycling. When required, equipment to be recycled can be sorted by type or material to facilitate more detailed client reporting based on weight, material type and piece count.
### Certificate of Destruction
The Certificate of Destruction provides proof that all e-waste or other proprietary equipment has been destroyed and disposed in an environmentally compliant manner. 
### Certificate of Responsible Recycling
The Certificate of Recycling provides proof that all assets have been responsibly recycled.
## Additional Reporting
![](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/05/Data-Destruction-3-720x396.png)
####  Data Destruction 
We provide Certificates of Data Destruction to confirm data has been destroyed, compliant with relevant regulations and standards. It is common to include project number, client name, asset numbers, serial number of hard drive and asset type.
![QBR quarterly business review](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/client-services-5.png)
####  Financial Reporting 
Financial reporting provides financial settlement details by asset. This report also documents date received, the client location from which the equipment was received, make, model, serial number, asset ID and weight, if applicable. Client use this report to close out internal financial and asset management records. Client defined fields are available for additional data capture when required.
![wind turbine](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/environmental-1.png)
####  Certificate of Sustainability 
The Certificate of Sustainability shows the beneficial environmental offsets (carbon emission reduction) gained by reusing and recycling retired IT assets and electronics. Carbon emission reductions can be calculated based on number of IT assets disposed or can be calculated based on weight (in lbs or kgs) of e-waste recycled.

## **Why Destroy Data On-Premise?**
Don’t take any unnecessary risks. When security is absolutely paramount, you need to ensure your data is destroyed while data bearing equipment is still in your custody. This removes all data risks associated with transporting material. 
SLS offers a range of services for destroying sensitive data at the data center. We help you meet regulatory requirements for data protection and avoid non-compliance penalties. 
### SLS offers data destruction services for:
  * Disk arrays, including storage area networks (SAN) and network area storage (NAS)

## Edge Data Centers (Modular Data Centers)
Edge data centers provide a local boost in processing capacity and reduced latency when needed. Also known as micro data centers, or micro-modular data centers (MMDC), they are typically self-contained and include servers, IT infrastructure, mechanical and electrical support. 
SLS provides turn-key decommissioning of these satellite data centers when they have outlived their useful life. In addition to destroying data on storage media, we decommission server racks, electrical and mechanical systems. Assets with resale value are sold, and other equipment is responsibly recycled.

## Smart Teams. Resourceful Solutions. Automation for Scaling.
## Services for Cloud Data Centers
As equipment is upgraded and older equipment is retired, hyperscale data centers require a vendor who can provide scaled solutions and expertise in repurposing data center equipment.
SLS provides innovative and nimble solutions for extending the lifecycle of retired data center equipment. We are expanding our use of robotics, virtual reality, and machine learning to provide solutions that handle hyperscale volumes.
Our recent track record demonstrates our ability to be agile when needed, to meet aggressive timelines and provide solid business solutions. SLS is a business of Sims Limited, a publicly traded company. The ability to scale at speed and to fund, innovate and deliver services sets SLS apart. 
![two sims lifecycle services employees moving server racks](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/SLS-Processing-1556-1024x563.png)
![stack of servers](https://www.simslifecycle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/SLS-Product-3939-1024x563.png)
## Original Design Servers (ODS)
Custom-built servers and processors are common in hyperscale data centers. These proprietary servers change the typical reuse / recycling decisions for retired IT equipment.
We work with clients to provide guidance on how this equipment is best repurposed.
  * Can parts be harvested for stocking inventory or resale?
  * How do we ensure proprietary parts are secured and destroyed?
  * Can equipment be redeployed to other company-owned locations?
  * Is secure recycling the best way to protect any intellectual property?

## Sustainable Data Center Decommissioning
The systematic reuse and recycling of retired IT equipment yields positive sustainability results by decreasing mining of natural resources to produce new products. Landfill volumes are also reduced helping to drive a circular economy.
[Learn More](https://www.simslifecycle.com/global/client-sustainability/sustainability-reporting/)
## Build-to-Suit Custom Recovery Facility
We work with hyperscalers to build and operate dedicated recovery facilities to process used equipment. These secure, custom built processing centers are staffed with SLS personnel and are sized to meet the volume demands of the largest cloud providers.
### Reporting and Data Visualization
Data integration and visualization of production data are central to our data center services. We map and build custom solutions via API and EDI.
[Explore More with a Representative](https://www.simslifecycle.com/contact/)
## Strategic Redeployment
SLS Circular Centers focus on fulfilment for cloud data center clients. Clients send used servers to SLS, which we inventory and upgrade to their specifications. We hold the partial or near completed servers and, when the client orders equipment with a particular configuration, we install the required components and complete the order.

## Channel Returns
Many Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) need to destroy large quantities of their product from time to time. This may be the result of surplus inventory, out-of-date models, defective merchandise or channel returns. SLS’s “Brand Protection through Destruction” program provides reverse logistics and guarantees destruction of this equipment, ensuring it will not re-enter the marketplace or appear on resale or auction sites.

SLS is sensitive to the issues surrounding the unauthorized use and resale of consumer electronics on the gray market, and actively work with our clients to ensure the integrity of their brand, data and trade secrets. Electronic OEMs trust SLS to ensure products are kept off the grey market and to provide complete documentation of destruction.
